This documentation outlines the steps to integrate Single Sign-On (SSO) using Microsoft Azure Active Directory (AD) with MileApp. This integration allows users to authenticate using their Azure AD credentials.
Before you begin, ensure you have the following:
1. **Azure AD Subscription**: A valid Azure AD account with administrator privileges.
2. **MileApp Access**: Access to the MileApp administration settings.
3. **Application Registration**: An application registered in Azure AD for MileApp.
###   

### Step 1: Register MileApp in Azure AD
1. **Log into the Azure Portal**: Navigate to [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/).

1. Once logged in, click on the **App Launcher** (the grid icon) on the left-hand side of the screen.
2. Select **MileApp** from the list of available applications to access the MileApp web platform.

By following these steps, you will be successfully logged into MileApp through your Microsoft account integrated with Azure SSO.

#### Notes:
1. If you already have a MileApp account and want to integrate it with Azure SSO, ensure that the email registered in Azure AD matches the email used in your MileApp account.
2. If the email registered in Azure AD differs from the email registered in MileApp, it will be considered a separate account.
3. If a user has been invited through MileApp but has not completed the verification process via email and is then registered in Azure using the same email, they cannot log in to MileApp until the verification is complete. You can complete the verification process via email or delete the unverified user in the **User Settings** menu to allow access.
#### Tips:
1. Ensure you have **View** and **Create Integration** permissions to configure the integration.
2. You can still set a password in MileApp even after your account is registered in Azure. The password can be used for logging in through the MileApp login page.
