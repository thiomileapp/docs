The "Automation Type: Create and Assign Task" feature is designed to streamline the process of automatically creating and assigning a new task to a specified assignee.

The process of creating this type of automation is akin to other types. Begin by providing a name for the automation and defining the necessary rules. When selecting "Create and Assign Task" as the Automation Type, pay attention to the details in the Automation setup:
1. **Create Task**. Choose the workflow for the task to be automatically created.
2. **Hub**. Select the hub to which the task belongs.
3. **Initial Page**. Fill in the initial page details for the task.
4. After completing the Initial Page, you will encounter the "**Auto Assignment**" switch. This powerful feature allows you to automate task assignments based on various criteria, such as 'done by,' 'assigned by,' or 'assigned' users.
5. **Assignee**. This step determines who will be responsible for completing the task.

The options in the Assignee dropdown depend on the 'Auto Assignment' toggle. If you don't activate the 'Auto Assignment' toggle, you can manually designate an Assignee according to the user you want to assign. If you activate it, you can assign tasks based on 'done by,' 'assigned by,' or 'assigned' users. This step determines who will be responsible for completing the task.
