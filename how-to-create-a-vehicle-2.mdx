1. **Click the "New" button** to add a new vehicle.
2. **Load Sample Data**: Use this option to view an example of vehicle data.
3. **Fill in the Necessary Fields** for each vehicle.
When finished, click the Submit button to continue. The newly created vehicle will be active by default.
Below are detailed guidelines for each input:
1. **Name**. Input the vehicle's name, which can include identifiers like a police number (e.g., B 1234 SYZ).
2. **Assignee**. Select the user to be assigned to this vehicle, or leave this empty. You can assign the user later when routing is done.
3. **Working Time**. Specify the vehicle's daily working hours; if not, the default is 08:00 to 17:00. Empty vehicles adopt the working hours of others if specified. For more detail, please see the Working Time section below.
4. **Break Time**. Configure break time for the vehicle within the specified working start and end time. For more detail, please see the Break Time section below.
5. **Speed**. Define the vehicle's speed, ensuring it meets a minimum of 5 km/h. Note: this field will be disabled if you activate "Auto Speed" in the Configuration page.
6. **Cost Factor**. The Cost Factor value ranges from 0 to 100, with the default value set to 0. A lower number indicates a higher priority for routing optimization purposes.
7. **Vehicle Tags**. Use tags to pair visits with vehicles, optimizing routes by matching tags for efficient assignments. Ensure that one or more vehicle tags match the tags of the visit you wish to filter. Please refer to the scenarios below for more understanding:
    1. **Scenario 1**: If a vehicle has 2 tags ("a" and "b") while the visit has 3 tags ("a", "b", and "c"), then this visit will be dropped.
    2. **Scenario 2**: If a vehicle has 3 tags ("a", "b", and "c") while the visit also has 3 tags ("a", "b", and "c"), then this visit will be optimized.
    3. **Scenario 3**: If a vehicle has 4 tags ("a", "b", "c", and "d") while the visit has 3 tags ("a", "b", and "c"), then this visit will be optimized.
8. **Capacity Constraint**. Define the minimum and maximum capacity for each vehicle. The capacity is based on the selected capacity in the Routing/Configuration menu.

## Working Time
By **default**, the timeframe is set from **08:00** to **17:00**. However, users can adjust this according to their specific requirements. This parameter restricts any visits to occur within the specified timeframe. Empty vehicles, those without explicitly defined working hours, will adopt the working hours of other vehicles if specified.
Additionally, if the parameter "return to hub" is enabled, users have the option to set the working time for more than one day. This feature facilitates planning for extended periods, allowing users to simultaneously plan routes multiple days.
### Working Time Validation
When inputting working hours, ensure that the starting time precedes the ending time. Failure to adhere to this rule will prompt a validation message, guiding you to correct the error before proceeding.

## Break Time
It's crucial to understand that when configuring breaks for multiday operations, the break schedule remains consistent across all days. For example, if the Working Time spans from 07:00 to 17:00 with an additional day, and the Break Time is set from 12:00 to 13:00, the vehicle will take a break from 12:00 to 13:00 each day.
For a comprehensive understanding of how working time, break time, and multiday settings interact, consider the following scenarios:
*   If the **break start time falls after the end of the working time**, the optimization will **fail**. For example:
    *   Working Time: 19:00 - 05:00 +1 day (7:00 PM - 5:00 AM)
    *   Break Time: 06:00 - 07:00 (6:00 AM - 7:00 AM)
*   If the **break occurs within the working time**, the optimization will **succeed**. For example:
    *   Working Time: 19:00 - 05:00 +1 day (7:00 PM - 5:00 AM)
    *   Break Time: 00:00 - 01:00 (12:00 AM - 1:00 AM)
*   If the **break start time precedes the start of the working time**, the optimization will **fail**. For example:
    *   Working Time: 19:00 - 05:00 +1 day (7:00 PM - 5:00 AM)
    *   Break Time: 18:00 - 19:00 (6:00 PM - 7:00 PM)
### Break Time Validation
Similar to working time validation, ensure that the break start time precedes the break end time to avoid any validation errors.
