# Synchronized Task & Visit

![](https://t3837933.p.clickup-attachments.com/t3837933/1ef9e958-4646-450f-b671-24ddd112caf5/image.png)
The visit page & Task page are synced, a task that is suitable for Route Optimization (1) will be shown on visit page (2).

Visits are generated from a Routable Task, you could create a Visit by creating a new Task, if it is considered as a Routable Task will be shown on the Visit page and compatible with route optimization.

**Do**

When you change information in a Task page it will be synced in both Task & Visit pages, including address and coordinate change.

**Warning**

Be careful if you want to Delete one or multiple Tasks because they will be deleted permanently from both Task & Visit pages.

# Routable Task

A Routable Task that is suitable for Route Optimization must have at least 3 [Routing Configurations in the Flow:](https://web.mile.app/flow/flow) VisitName, Address & Coordinate.

Below is an example of a minimum setting for a Routable Task's Flow:

![](https://t3837933.p.clickup-attachments.com/t3837933/8495c4a9-a097-434a-b24f-d1a07253bc81/2.png)
1. Create these 3 components in the Flow's Initial Page, and set the Type according to the example above. These 3 components are needed for the configuration setting.
2. Adjust this 3 Routing configuration for the Flow's component according to the setting above. These 3 configurations will take the value from those components on the Initial Page.

After the Flow setting is correct, the Task created using this Flow would be shown on the Visit page and suitable for Route Optimization. For the rest of the form & configuration setting, you could customize it to suit your needs.

# Creating Visit

Visits are generated from a Routable Task, you could create a Visit by creating a new Task if it is considered a Routable Task will be shown on the Visit page.

To know about how to set up a proper Visit from scratch, we advise you to check our guide below:

![](https://t3837933.p.clickup-attachments.com/t3837933/29c5faad-da4f-42dd-83a8-f2784f6556e3/User%20Flow%20diagram%20-%20Create%20Visit.png)

The routable Task that you have created should show up on the Visit page, here is the structure of the Visit page:

![](https://t3837933.p.clickup-attachments.com/t3837933/aa2752a8-9d32-4420-8838-eeb63c191158/3.png)
1. Search Visit by keyword
2. Filter Visit by status
3. Number of available visits / active visit
4. Toggle to activate or deactivate all Visit, Optimization only includes active Visit
5. Toggle to activate or deactivate individual Visit, if inactive Visit won't be included in the Optimization
6. Configuration setting
7. Optimize Button
8. The pin icon will represent the state of a Visit coordinate:
a. Green icon represents a valid visit coordinate (latitude, longitude)
b. Yellow icon represents that a geocoding process is running, geocode process will allow our
engine to find the coordinate of the Address information that you have input on a Visit.
c. Red icons represent that a coordinate or a valid address is not found, we advise you to check
the address and coordinate on Visit that has a red pin icon.
1. Map preview of the Visit, each number represents the Visit, and the "H" icon represents the Hub

# Build a Routable Task's Flow

![](https://t3837933.p.clickup-attachments.com/t3837933/1b87d99a-6008-4ea3-a880-6e85bdd0efac/2.png)
First, you should set the Task's Flow that you want to use as Visit. The required settings are the 3 Component in Form (1), after you set up the form's component, you should set the Configuration for those components (2), only the highlighted field is necessary for a Routable Task.

You could set the rest of the Form and Configuration settings to suit your needs, we advise you to read about [how to set a Flow here](https://doc.clickup.com/3837933/p/h/3n3zd-69742/a19f897c84a6476/3n3zd-69782) for more information.

# Create a Routable Task

After you set up a Routable Task Flow, you could choose to add a new Task through the single task input or multiple tasks.

![](https://t3837933.p.clickup-attachments.com/t3837933/e291a8b2-ee2c-433f-a563-9e677b6379ad/image.png)
1. Create one Task
2. Create multiple Tasks manually

# Create one Task

![](https://t3837933.p.clickup-attachments.com/t3837933/14b00e1e-d2cb-459f-ab2b-c01c1910e5cc/8.png)
1. Select a Flow
2. Fill in the information (this field will be varied based on your Flow setting)
3. You could use the default configuration, or you could adjust the Start and End time manually.

# Create multiple Task

![](https://t3837933.p.clickup-attachments.com/t3837933/6a1ef238-d128-4887-b71f-23bee7cf489b/11.png)
1. Select a Flow
2. Fill in the information (this field will vary based on your Flow setting)
3. You could use the default configuration, or you could adjust the Start and End time manually.
4. Action button to add or delete Task

# Bulk Import Task

![](https://t3837933.p.clickup-attachments.com/t3837933/1db5444b-d6f8-4eae-a1c2-e7db3cd6d55a/19.png)
You could import multiple tasks at the same time with the add Bulk Task button (1).

![](https://t3837933.p.clickup-attachments.com/t3837933/85907afb-0d18-41cd-a456-9e8ec6c9bb15/1.png)
After you click the add Bulk Task button, you'll see the form above, **and you have to choose a Flow setting (1) first,** after that you could use the Import Task function (2), as shown below:

![](https://t3837933.p.clickup-attachments.com/t3837933/b8c72246-5cce-46c0-ac4c-cd106b461358/12.png)
1. After you choose a Task Flow that you'd like to import in bulk, download the templates for import based on that flow.
2. You should automatically download the .xlsx file after clicking the download button, and open the file once it's downloaded.
3. Fill in the information in the file
4. Drag and drop the file to this field to import the Task from the file that you have edited

After you have finished importing the task, the highlighted field will be updated according to the information that you input in the .xlsx file. You could still check and edit the information here before you submit the Task.

![](https://t3837933.p.clickup-attachments.com/t3837933/b1745572-c888-4983-9fd8-aca5f9f83cad/13.png)

Choosing a Flow setting is necessary before starting an import Bulk Task action sequence, because flow setting would affect the information inside the .xlsx file, and would affect the result of the Imported Task on the web.

**Do**

If you want to import Task in bulk, please make sure you re-download Task's Flow import templates if you change any of the settings in the Flow.

# Routable Task = Visit

![](https://t3837933.p.clickup-attachments.com/t3837933/c7308602-e342-4c4e-a5ec-153ad7d4a6e0/image.png)
After you set a proper Routable Task Flow and create a Task with that Flow, every task that you create should automatically be shown on the Visit page.

You could go to the Visit page to continue the Route Optimization process.

# Routable Task Status

A Routable Task that will be shown on the Visit page is a Task haven't passed its End Time (not expired), and have Ongoing or Unassigned status, as shown below:

![](https://t3837933.p.clickup-attachments.com/t3837933/d7ba4e11-7a06-4bba-b11b-4a99942074eb/3.png)
1. A routable task that has Unassigned status, and is still active (hasn't passed its End time), will be shown on the Visit page.
2. A routable task that has Ongoing status (assigned to a field user), and is still active, will be shown on the Visit page.
3. A routable task that has Unassigned status, but has expired (has passed its End time), will not be shown on the Visit page. The expired task's "Assign To" selection field are disabled and greyed out.
4. A routable task that has been done will not be shown on the Visit page. Done task's "Assign To" selection field is disabled and will be shown in blue color. Also, Task with Done status can't be assigned, unassigned, move, or deleted.

The task that has expired (End time has passed) won't be shown on the Visit page and can't be optimized. The solution for this is to update the Task's End time.

**Do**

When you change information in a Task page it will be synced in both Task & Visit pages, including address and coordinate change.

**Warning**

Be careful if you want to Delete one or multiple Tasks because they will be deleted permanently from both Task & Visit pages.

# Using Demo Data

With Demo Data, you'll get a glimpse of what MileApp has to offer, right from your Dashboard to the Routing/Vehicle and Task menus.

# Dashboard

As a new user, this feature is designed to help you get a quick grasp of what the Dashboard has to offer. Here, you will find sample demo data if you meet the following criteria:
*   You are a new user who **registered** less than 1 month ago.
*   Your task usage is still at 0.
The demo data has been carefully created to provide a realistic representation of what your Dashboard could look like with real task information. It is visually appealing and meant to give you an immediate understanding of the Dashboard's features.
## Welcome Banner
A welcoming banner will be displayed, showing "Welcome to MileApp! We provide you with demo data to enhance your MileApp experience. Demo data will be cleared once you create your first task. **Create a task** now or **Watch a video** tutorial." You can hover over the 'i' icon on the banner to get additional information. It will inform you that if you don't create a task within 30 days, the demo data will be automatically cleared to keep your dashboard fresh.
## Automatic Removal of Demo Data
As soon as you **create your first task** within MileApp, the demo data will be automatically removed from the Dashboard. Additionally, if you **have not created a task within 30 days**, the demo data will also be cleared.
The deleted Demo Data **will not be saved in the Trash**. Therefore, you will not be able to retrieve or view the deleted demo data in the Menu Settings/Trash. It is permanently removed from your MileApp account.
## Additional Information
*   **Data Display:**
    *   The Dashboard will display data from the last 7 days based on your login date.
    *   The filter flow can be set to show all default flow options.
*   **Flow Selection:** The flow filter will only display the flow options you selected during account verification.
*   **Date Filters:** By default, the filter date automatically selects the last 7 days, but you can choose other dates. However, the displayed results will always be the same.
*   **Hub Data:** Regardless of the hub you filter, the demo data will always appear the same, as it is associated with the hub you created during verification.

![](https://t3837933.p.clickup-attachments.com/t3837933/50f8657a-96d3-40c4-9065-92315486f324/image.png)
_Demo Data in Dashboard Menu_

# Task

Demo data is designed to assist new users in exploring MileApp more easily. New users who haven't created their own tasks within their organization will receive demo data tasks. This includes 10 demo data tasks, all utilizing the same flow. Among these tasks, 8 have an 'ONGOING' status and are assigned to the user who created the account, 1 task is 'UNASSIGNED,' and 1 task is marked as 'DONE.'

### Welcome Banner
A welcome banner will be displayed as long as the organization has no tasks created by its users. You can also access a video tutorial on task creation by clicking "**Watch a video tutorial!**" or you can create your first task by clicking "**Create your first task**" within the information displayed in the sentence: "Welcome to MileApp! We provide you with demo data to enhance your MileApp experience. Demo data will be cleared once you Create your first task. **Create a task now** or **Watch a video tutorial.**"

### Using Demo Data Tasks
Demo data tasks function just like regular tasks. You can work on them, export them, route them, track them, and engage in various activities within MileApp using these tasks.

### Data Deletion
Demo data tasks will be deleted as soon as a user within the organization creates a task. Additionally, demo data tasks are only available in the first hub created; they won't appear in other hubs.

# What is Hub?

![](https://t3837933.p.clickup-attachments.com/t3837933/ad02fcd4-7256-47cd-a20c-1724a27916b5/2.png)
_You can_ **_switch_** _between hubs from the top right corner of almost any page_
[**Hub**](https://web.mile.app/setting/hub) acts as the central point for your field team & vehicles in an area. A Hub is required to create tasks and routes. A hub can represent a warehouse, distribution center, office, or place that act as the center of your operation.

You can create multiple hubs and assign different users to each hub, each user can also be set varying levels of permission of what they can and can't do from the [setting->permission](https://web.mile.app/setting/permission) page.

# Creating a Hub after Registering

When registering a new account, you must set up a Hub before you can use [MileApp](https://web.mile.app/).
You need to set a Hub correctly and make sure the information is valid because most of the features in MileApp are linked or related to a Hub.

For example, whenever a task is created, it is only created in one hub and only accessible to users that are given permission to that specific Hub.
Hub is also essential to create Route because every time Routing is done, it needs a starting point and Hub acts as that starting point.

![](https://t3837933.p.clickup-attachments.com/t3837933/0f2fcfed-596c-4040-8b39-dcc2152c28a2/2.png)
_Fill in the form hub from the verification page_
1. Enter the Hub address here, and choose the correct address from the list, after which the system will automatically generate a coordinate with the Pin marker on the map.
2. If you feel the Pin marker is not accurate, you can drag the Pin marker manually to adjust the Hub location
3. Write the name of the Hub here (ex "Warehouse 1", "Office New York")
4. Coordinate will be filled automatically based on the search result or the manual adjustment of the Pin marker on the map.
5. The address form will be filled out automatically after the Hub location has been chosen. You are free to rewrite the address manually if you think it is inaccurate.

# Deleting a Hub

![](https://t3837933.p.clickup-attachments.com/t3837933/283cb353-1e0a-40b0-9fe7-e43089dff1c5/image.png)
_Setting ➝ Hub page_
Click the Delete button (1) to Delete a Hub, after you click the button you'll be asked again to Delete the Hub permanently.

**Warning**

*   Be very careful if you want to delete a Hub because when you Delete a Hub it will also permanently delete all information that contains in it such as Task information, Visit information, Vehicle information & other information that was contained in a Hub.
*   You can't delete a Hub if it is still assigned to any User, so you will need to remove the assignation of users from the [Setting->User](https://web.mile.app/setting/user) page first before deleting a Hub .

# How and where is Hub used?

*   **Switching between Hub**

![](https://t3837933.p.clickup-attachments.com/t3837933/72f16865-1721-4e1e-b057-0cff43f9fd00/4.png)

_Select box hub_

Users assigned to more than 1 Hub can move between Hubs to access information in a specific Hub from the dropdown menu (1) located on the top right of most pages. Only the user assigned to a Hub could access the information within it. You can assign a user to one or more Hub(s) (2) from the [Setting->User](https://web.mile.app/setting/user) page.

*   **Hub as a Center of operation**

Hub is the place where all your Tasks from an area or region of operation are contained, so every Hub can have independent Tasks.

*   **Hub information access**

Be mindful that when assigning users to a Hub or multiple Hubs, a user (based on permission setting) could see or change information at the Hub that they are assigned to.

# Registration & Verification



# Register to MileApp

## Organization Setup
If you are the first user from your Organization to register to the MileApp, you will also need to set up your Organization information along with your user account simultaneously.

But, if your organization is already registered to the MileApp you could invite other users from the 
[Setting - User](https://web.mile.app/setting/user) page instead.

## Registration Process
There are 2 ways to register your email to MileApp, by using the Sign up with Google account button or sign up manually by inputting your email and password manually.

![](https://t3837933.p.clickup-attachments.com/t3837933/44cb2731-b276-40d6-9c50-ee6d7281858e/image.png)

1. If you use the **Sign up with Google button** you will be redirected to our Verification page, and you could continue the process from there.
2. If you use the **Manual Sign up method** you will need to confirm your email by clicking the activate button / copy the verification link on the email that we send to you before you could access the Verification page. This is the sample of the Verification email that you would receive after inputting your email & password at the manual sign up method:

![](https://t3837933.p.clickup-attachments.com/t3837933/40728859-b613-4ad3-b8fa-da229eeeecc3/image.png)

After you finish the Registration step by using your Google account or manual sign up method, you will need to Verify your information at our verification process.

# Verify Your Information

The next step after you complete the Registration process is to fill in your information at our Verification process, this step is necessary to submit your Organization data to MileApp. This step will only be necessary if you are the first account to register to MileApp in your Organization.

## Verification Process
After you finish the registration using a Google account or manual sign up, you will have to verify your Organization information during the verification process. Four steps in this verification process enable you to fill in your personal & organization information.

The **first step** of the verification is to confirm the personal information that will be used on your user account. Your user account information is editable at the [User setting page](https://web.mile.app/setting/user) and profile menu.

![](https://t3837933.p.clickup-attachments.com/t3837933/f241c302-31b1-4a66-acc3-1e0f6fd3366a/image%20(2).png)
*   **Name** that would be used on your user account.
*   The **Phone number** that will be used as the contact info of your organization.
*   Your **Position** in your Organization / Company.

The **second step** of the verification is your organization information, this information will be kept as your Organization information. You could adjust your Organization information later inside the
[MileApp web setting](https://web.mile.app/setting/organization) page.

![](https://t3837933.p.clickup-attachments.com/t3837933/4364602f-e6ad-426d-a5ee-5cf5c16e9e10/image%20(3).png)
*   The **Organization name** will be used in your organization detail.
*   Choose the **Country** where your company is operating.
*   Choose the **Industry** type of your company.
*   Choose the **Employee size** of your company.

In the **third step** you could input the Hub name and location that you use as a center of your organization operation, this could represent a warehouse, distribution center, office, or such. This Hub will be used on various processes at MileApp, you could adjust this Hub location later inside the MileApp web. Also, you could add more Hub locations later inside the MileApp web once you finished the Verification process.

![](https://t3837933.p.clickup-attachments.com/t3837933/1b6b6692-6564-4ab1-8419-f37cde3b7a72/image.png)
*   The **Hub Name** that you use in your organization.
*   Your organization's **Hub Location**, you could adjust this later inside of [MileApp setting page](https://web.mile.app/setting/hub) once you finished the verification process.

The **fourth** and final step of the verification enables you to choose the Flow that suits your business process. Flow is the process flow of a task, it defines the information that can be viewed and filled by the user in a task, this information is segregated into pages, and each page can have several components that are suited to the field process. You could customize this flow later inside the MileApp web after you finished the verification process.

![](https://t3837933.p.clickup-attachments.com/t3837933/313ad423-0e67-4648-9256-6a4977486a26/image.png)
These 6 default Flow that we provide could help you to start your journey using MileApp, you could create a Task directly by using these default flow. You could also only choose Flow that suits your business process or industry.

# Creating A Hub

The "**Hub**" is the main control center for your organizational tasks. It is usually the central place in your organization where field users start **their day,** such as the warehouse, office, or delivery center.

An organization can have **multiple** hubs that separate its tasks so everything stays organized. Users can be part of one or more hubs based on their tasks. This helps everyone to work together and finish tasks on time.

You can **switch** between hubs from the top right corner of almost any page.
![](https://t3837933.p.clickup-attachments.com/t3837933/076cb89b-207f-4b6f-a140-9a5050b306c8/image.png)

You must create your first hub when registering your account, after which you can create, edit, and delete hubs from the [Setting➝Hub](https://web.mile.app/setting/hub) page.

![](https://t3837933.p.clickup-attachments.com/t3837933/c33291da-c19f-460a-bebf-f45dfc534715/image.png)
_Creating a hub from the Setting➝Hub page_

You can configure which user gets access to which Hub from the Setting➝User page; this page also allows you to invite new users and configure their roles.

![](https://t3837933.p.clickup-attachments.com/t3837933/a60bbe64-7296-40b2-a899-c7eb5185a288/image.png)
_Managing user role and hub from the Setting➝User page_

More details about the hub can be found [here](https://app.clickup.com/3837933/v/dc/3n3zd-38402/3n3zd-181216).

# Creating A Flow

Flow is the process flow of a task; it defines the information that can be **viewed** and **filled** by the user when they are doing their job on the field.
Flow is segregated into **pages**, and each page can have several **components** that are suited to the field process

MileApp lets you create a flow from scratch or edit one from an existing template from the [Flow](https://web.mile.app/flow/flow) page; some commonly used flows are
*   Delivery
*   Pickup
*   Inspection
*   Canvassing
*   Field Sales

MileApp has many ready-to-use editable templates to start with

![](https://t3837933.p.clickup-attachments.com/t3837933/77d9bc3f-1730-43d3-989b-f8baac31b492/image.png)
_Creating a flow from an existing template from the Flow page_

![](https://t3837933.p.clickup-attachments.com/t3837933/9e675fc4-9ba1-441c-b3b4-05892ced6a8d/image.png)
_Various flow templates to start with_

Once you have created a flow from a template or a new one from scratch, you can start editing its pages and components.

## Pages
The types of pages are
*   **Initial Page** ➝ This page is shown to the user when the task is first created; all input information on this page needs to be filled in when the task is created; there can be only 1 Initial Page.
*   **Normal Page** ➝ These pages are shown to the user when the task is being done; you can add multiple pages by using the **Add Page** button

![](https://t3837933.p.clickup-attachments.com/t3837933/572c83f6-9507-47e0-9966-035213acb958/Flow.png)

Why is the Initial Page important?
The normal life cycle of a task is
1. **Task Created** ➝ When the admin or field user first creates the task
2. **Task Assigned** ➝ When the admin is assigning the task to the field user
3. **Task Done** ➝ When the field user has done the task

In most cases, the user that creates the task is different from the one doing it _(for example, the admin creates the task, assigns it to the field user, and then the field user does the task);_ therefore_,_ the initial page distinguishes information to be inputted by the admin from the field user.

MileApp also allows the task to be created directly by the user doing it, skipping the assignment part altogether; in cases such as this, the initial page doesn't have any difference from the other pages.
## Components
Each page can have one or more components to be used by the users; the types of components are

_Flow Display Menu_

[**Flow**](https://web.mile.app/flow/flow) in MileApp is the mobile field application workflow, setting it correctly is critical to the success of the field workers in doing their job efficiently. Flow defines how information is presented to the field workers and what data they need to fill in and update on the mobile app.

An organization is allowed to create an unlimited number of Flows, regardless of its license plan, enabling it to utilize MileApp for various field operations. For instance, an organization acting as a distributor can use MileApp for pickup, delivery, and field sales. However, each Flow has a component limit based on the organization’s license plan:
*   Free: 50 components
*   Pro: 200 components
*   Enterprise: As needed

Components are the building blocks of flow, MileApp comes with various components that can be used in a flow such as:
*   View component ➝ used to present information to user in the form of text, image, link, date, etc.
*   Input component ➝ used to give input
*   Select component ➝ used to give options
*   Photo component ➝ used to capture image from camera
*   Signature component ➝ used to verify identity
*   Bill component ➝ Used to display and manage billing information
*   List component ➝ Used to display and manage of information in a list format
*   Timer component ➝ used to track the duration of a task
*   Voice Note component ➝ Used to record audio
*   Capture component ➝ Used to capturing data

_Flow Menu Display_

Flow settings are managed within the Pages & Configuration tab. You can only create or edit flow settings through the web interface. To create a new flow, click the New Flow button (1).
The information you configure in the flow settings may appear in the web app, the mobile app, or both, depending on the flow type.

Creating a flow from scratch will provide you with a blank flow that can be fully customized to suit your needs. However, for first-time users, we do not recommend starting with a blank flow, as it requires a basic understanding of how to properly configure a flow.

We have also provided several ready-to-use flows that are pre-generated and automatically set up when you register your account. You can either use them as they are or customize them to suit your needs:
*   Pickup
*   Delivery
*   Field Sales
*   Field Canvassing
*   Home Cleaning
*   House Inspection
We advise first-time users to explore the ready-to-use flows or flow templates before creating one from scratch.

3. Toggle to enable the Reset button on the mobile app task, if this is disabled, the Field user can't reset the timer.

# Component: Voice Note

The Voice Note Component is a type of component used to record audio for a task. You can record audio to meet specific needs, such as providing evidence of promotions conducted by field users or other requirements.

![](https://t3837933.p.clickup-attachments.com/t3837933/e4590cef-3dd2-4780-8596-e0917a504648/image.png)
**_Component voice note settings_**

1. **Max Duration:** This setting allows you to set the maximum recording time in minutes.
2. **Toggle Required:** This option makes the voice note component mandatory. If not filled, users cannot proceed to other activities.
3. **Toggle Visibility:** This setting affects the visibility of the component during task creation on the web and mobile, as well as task viewing on the mobile app. If the component is not visible, it will not be shown in the UI. However, both visible and hidden component data will be exported, regardless of their visibility status.

# Configuration: Task List

Configuration setting in the Task list will affect how a task is shown on the Task page, for example, you could use the customer name for the Title, the address of the customer for the Content, etc. You could choose any compatible component for this list based on your needs.

![](https://t3837933.p.clickup-attachments.com/t3837933/e6b8bc17-4b17-46a8-9cde-296288625a4b/11.png)
1. The component title that you choose here will become the Task title in the task list
2. The component title that you choose here will become the Content title in the task list
3. The component title that you choose here will become the Label title in the task list

# Configuration: Route

Route configuration is a crucial step when creating tasks that are suitable for Route Optimization within your workflow. While route configuration is optional, we strongly recommend configuring at least three essential fields for visit details: Visit Name, Address, and Coordinate. Without this configuration, you can still perform routing optimization, but the values will not be saved to the data task.

Please note that only compatible components can be chosen for routing configuration.

![](https://t3837933.p.clickup-attachments.com/t3837933/2e23f8fc-8210-4741-8d93-e517017c92af/10.png)
1. Visit Name
    *   The component selected as Visit Name will be displayed as the "Name" on a Visit.
    *   Only input components with the type "Text" can be chosen as the Visit Name.
    *   If this field is left empty, the name of the visit will be taken from the Title in the Task List configuration.
2. Address
    *   The component selected as Address will be shown as the "Address" on a Visit.
    *   Only input components with the type "Address" can be chosen as the Address.
    *   If this field is left empty, the address will be empty in the visit details, and you will need to input it manually for each visit
3. Open Time
    *   The component chosen as Open Time will be displayed as the "Open Time" on a Visit.
    *   Open Time represents the start of the desired time window for executing the visit.
    *   Only input components with the type "Time" can be chosen as Open Time.
4. Close Time
    *   The component chosen as Close Time will be displayed as the time below the Open Time on a Visit.
    *   Close Time represents the end of the desired time window for executing the visit.
    *   Only input components with the type "Time" can be chosen as Close Time.
5. Visit Duration
    *   The component chosen as Visit Duration will be displayed as the "Visit Time" on a Visit.
    *   Visit Time represents the idle time in minutes after reaching each visit.
    *   Only input components with the type "Number" can be chosen as Visit Duration.
    *   Please note that the value for visit time must be an integer, as it represents minutes.
6. Coordinate
    *   The component chosen as Coordinate will be shown as the "Coordinate" on a Visit.
    *   We highly recommend using the Input component with the type "Coordinate" and activating the "Geocode" feature. This ensures accurate mapping of the visit's location on the map.
7. Tags
    *   The component selected as Tags will be shown as the "Visit tags" on a Visit.
    *   Visit tags are used to pair visits with vehicles or other relevant criteria. This is essential for optimizing routes by matching tags, thereby ensuring efficient assignments.
    *   Only input components with the type "Text" or "Select" can be chosen as Tags. You can use text input or a selection list to assign appropriate tags to visits.
These capacity constraints provide you with the ability to define and track specific attributes related to your visits, such as weight, volume, and width. By using these constraints, you can ensure that the capacity and physical requirements of each visit are taken into account during the route optimization process. **Please note that the available constraint options may vary depending on the configuration set in the Routing/Configuration menu, and the values entered can be decimal with a maximum of 1 number after the comma.**

1. Constraint: Weight
    *   The component chosen as Constraint Weight will be displayed as "Weight" on a Visit. This can be used to represent the total weight (Kg) of items included in the visit.
    *   Only input components with the type "Number" or "Currency" can be selected as the Constraint Weight.
2. Constraint: Volume
    *   The component chosen as Constraint Volume will be displayed as the "Volume" of a Visit. This can be used to represent the total volume (m³) of items included in the visit.
    *   Only input components with the type "Number" or "Currency" can be selected as the Constraint Volume.
3. Constraint: Width
    *   The component chosen as Constraint Width will be displayed as the "Width" of a Visit. This can be used to represent the total width (m) of items included in the visit.
    *   Only input components with the type "Number" or "Currency" can be selected as the Constraint Width.

Please note that if a component is already chosen for one of the fields, it will not be available for selection in any other fields. For example, if you select the "Invoice" component as the "Visit Name," then "Invoice" will not be visible as an option for any other field, such as "Tag."
By configuring these routing settings, you can ensure that your route optimization process operates smoothly and that visit details are accurately recorded in your tasks.

# Configuration: Time

Time configuration could be used to set the Start and the End time of a Task.

![](https://t3837933.p.clickup-attachments.com/t3837933/9f032c64-f8bc-4b83-b86e-fb33564dd568/9.png)
1. Start Time will define when a Task should be started to work on by the Field user, you could set it based on your needs, the default value is 0 hours from the time the Task is created, so by default a Task could be started right away after it is created.
2. End Time will define the deadline of a Task, you could set it based on your needs, the default value is 24 hours from the time the Task is started, so with default configuration, if you create a Task it will expire in 24 hours.

# Configuration: Data Source

A data source is a feature that enables you to utilize data when creating or working on tasks. To use a data source, you must map the component flow with the data source on the Configuration Tab.

![](https://t3837933.p.clickup-attachments.com/t3837933/a08461d8-60a4-4898-be39-509ec70d949e/image.png)
_Data source settings with flow_

To find out more about data sources, you can see here [Data Sources](https://doc.clickup.com/3837933/p/h/3n3zd-81962/aa00834626ae24f/3n3zd-95902)

The data source can only be stored with input, list and bill components. Here's how to map component flows with data sources.

**Input component :**
![](https://t3837933.p.clickup-attachments.com/t3837933/2c013352-b9a9-40f1-8b6d-910bd701a732/image.png)
_Mapping Input Components with Data Sources_

Here are the explanations for each number on the image:
1. Component Using Data Source: If you select an input component, you have the option to map a data source to each of these components. Furthermore, this component will also serve as the primary key in points 3 and 3.a.
2. Type of Data Source Used: Here, you need to choose the type of data source that will be utilized in this process.
3. Component Mapped with Primary Key Data Source: This component will be linked to the primary key of the chosen data source. The component that's mapped will also act as a trigger to select the data source when creating or working on tasks. The information in this field will be automatically populated after you map the component in point number one.
4. Component Mapped with Data Source

Please make sure to refer to the image above while following the steps mentioned to effectively utilize this feature. Should you have any further questions, feel free to contact our support team.

**List Component :**
![](https://t3837933.p.clickup-attachments.com/t3837933/a98a59d6-30d1-460d-84ed-b4b461e03e35/image.png)
_Mapping List Components with Data Sources_

Here are the explanations for the numbers on the image:
1. Selected Data Source Type: When choosing a data source type, ensure that the selected type has a Text field available for mapping with "Item Name," and a Number field available for mapping with "Item Qty."
2. Reserved Key "Item Name" and Text Field Type: Please note that the reserved key "Item Name" can only be mapped with a data source that has a Text field type. Ensure that you correctly map it according to the required field type.
3. Reserved Key "Item Qty" and Number Field Type: Similarly, the reserved key "Item Qty" can only be mapped with a data source that has a Number field type. Make sure to select the appropriate field type when mapping "Item Qty."

Please refer to the provided image while following the explanations above. If you have any further questions, feel free to reach out to our support team.

The bill component, it's quite similar to the list component, with the addition of one required reserved key to be mapped, which is "Item Price." Also, regarding the item price, it can only be mapped with a data source that has a Number field type.

[**Task Menu**](https://web.mile.app/tasks/task) is a central place for you to manage tasks, add a new task, import bulk tasks, assign tasks to a field user, check the status of each task, view details of each task, and export task reports. You could also monitor ongoing tasks and create a scheduled task from this menu.

# Introduction to Task

The Task is the core of MileApp, most of MileApp features are revolved around or started from a Task.

![](https://t3837933.p.clickup-attachments.com/t3837933/1f6375e8-b34e-4b98-a5f6-ce9ad0925a2f/Task%20as%20a%20Core.png)
*   Task enables you to manage your field user, for example, you could assign a Task to a Field user, after it was assigned they will see it on their mobile apps & could work on it through the apps.
*   Another example is, if you create a Task that is suitable for Route Optimization, you could optimize the visit route and your field user could work on it through their mobile apps.
*   Using a more advanced Task feature, you could create a task that is interconnected by using the Automation or Schedule feature.
*   You could set up a custom Flow for a Task based on your needs. The flow would also affect the mobile apps, so you could specify what your Field user could do when they work on the Task.

# Creating Task

There are few ways to create a Task, you could input or import it manually, create a scheduled task based on your needs, or generate it from the automation feature.

![](https://t3837933.p.clickup-attachments.com/t3837933/baae9499-8f1c-427a-9d67-78dab32e6f25/image.png)

# Tracking



# Introduction to Tracking

The Task Tracking system allows you to monitor the user's task & location. This page could help you to simplify the monitoring process of the user's current location, their location history, the current ongoing or finished task, their speed info based on the actual route that they take, and even an estimate of ETA for their next task.

![](https://t3837933.p.clickup-attachments.com/t3837933/3df26056-9449-4e69-880c-a210bee07b6f/image.png)

We highly suggest that you activate our Start Finish feature to ensure that your user locations are recorded properly to be shown here on the Tracking page.

## Set up the Start Finish Feature
The Task Tracking location histories will be generated properly if you activate the Start Finish feature from the [Permission page](https://web.mile.app/setting/permission). At the Start Finish feature setting you could define the recording interval of the user location history, and you could also define the radius around your hub that will only allow users to Start & Finish when they are around that radius distance from your hub.

This is where you set up the Start Finish feature:
1. Toggle to activate / deactivate this features
2. How often the coordinate of the MileApp Field user will be recorded
3. The radius around the hub where the MileApp Field user could start to accessing their task
4. The radius around the hub where the MileApp Field user could Finish to stopped accessing their task and stopped the coordinate recording

![](https://t3837933.p.clickup-attachments.com/t3837933/a236bc32-37a3-4090-b2c4-8e648494cfad/image.png)

For instance, you could set the coordinate recording interval to 5 minutes, which means the app will record the user's coordinates every 5 minutes.

Additionally, if you set the radius to 500 meters, the MileApp Field user could start accessing their task after they Start at 500 meters or less from the hub. The mobile app user will be able to access their task as long as they have Start.

This also applied to Finish radius of 500 meters, which requires users to be within 500 meters or less from the hub to Finish. After users are Finish, they have to Start again to access their tasks.

# General Information

There's plenty of information on the [Tracking page](https://web.mile.app/route/visit) that could help you to know the latest location of each user, know the status of each task, and see the last update time of the user & task.

The tracking page will show information from the current hub and the date that you choose. This is the list of information that you could find on the Tracking page.

## **General information**
This information will show you a summary of all users' information for that specific date, or if you haven't chosen a specific date, it will show today's date tracking history.

![](https://t3837933.p.clickup-attachments.com/t3837933/cf81cfd3-ccd9-4865-b70b-00bc29c6e2c5/image.png)
*   **Total User**

This counter for the Total user will show you the count of all Active & Inactive users in this Hub, this might not include some users in your organization, because the Tracking page will only show you user and location history from the active Hub that you choose.

*   **Total Done Task**

This counter will show you the total number of the Done Task from all user in the Hub, if this number show 7/7 Tasks as shown in the example above, it means that all of this day's task is done. But if it shows 0/7 Task, it means that there are still 7 Ongoing tasks on that day.

*   **Total Ongoing Task**

This counter will show you the total number of the Ongoing Task from all user in the Hub, if this number show 7/7 Tasks, it means that there are still 7 Ongoing task on that day. But if it shows 0/7 Task as shown in the example above, it means that all task on that day is Done.

*   **Total Travel Time**

This number is the total travel time of all users in the hub on that day, this number will only count the active user travel time.

*   **Total Travel Distance**

This number is the total travel distance of all users in the hub on that day, this number will only count the active user travel distance.

## Active User
The active user list will show users that have an active Task on that day. If you wish to see the detailed tracking history of each user, click on the user on the list to view their task & location detail.

### All Active User History
![](https://t3837933.p.clickup-attachments.com/t3837933/abb243d2-add5-43a4-bff0-d061a99f1a48/image.png) ![](https://t3837933.p.clickup-attachments.com/t3837933/110926fc-7d21-4d7f-9a21-082c671b69a8/image.png)
When you click this button, you will see all active user locations on the map view on the selected date. On the map, you will see multiple user icons that represent that user's current location.

This active user view will only show you the location of the user, if you wish to see the more detailed location history of each user, you should click and select the user on the list instead.

The Active user button will also show the current active user number on that day. You could collapse/expand the Active user list by clicking the arrow.

### Specific Active User History
If you wish to see the detailed location history of an active user, you should click their name first on the Active user list. After you choose a user, the map will show you a more detailed history of that user that include their current location, ongoing & done task location, and their start & finish location.

The planned route for the ongoing task & the actual route for the done task for this user will also be shown on the map.

## Inactive User
The inactive user list will show users that didn't have a task on that day. This list will only show you the name of the inactive user, so it can't be clicked because the inactive user didn't send any data that could be shown on the tracking map. You could collapse or expand the inactive user list by clicking the arrow on the right side.

![](https://t3837933.p.clickup-attachments.com/t3837933/4fd7cf46-b217-4e83-b4e6-290ee7238f14/image.png)

# Icons and Route Information

There are a few icons and information cards that you could find on the [Tracking page](https://web.mile.app/tasks/tracking) as your field user using the mobile app and finishing their task.

Some icons and cards will be displayed by default, while some will only be displayed if the user has done certain actions, if the task carries specific information, or after they Start or Finish their work.

## User Icon
The user icon will show you the latest location of the user on the map. You could click the user icon to show a card that contains more detail about the total task, done task, ongoing task, location history, and last updated information from that user. This information is visible both when you click a user icon on the all Active User view, or when you view a specific Active User activity after you click their name on the Active list.

![](https://t3837933.p.clickup-attachments.com/t3837933/7c8c0bbb-f435-4eed-9a06-faaf1982a260/image.png) ![](https://t3837933.p.clickup-attachments.com/t3837933/bb90681a-025e-4f34-ae79-d5ddb48015ca/image.png)
_All Active User view_ _Specific Active User view_

Detail explanation for each information on the information card:
*   **Last update**

The last update time is the most recent location history update from this user, the location history is generated when the user uses their mobile app and for better accuracy, you should use the [Start Finish feature](https://web.mile.app/setting/permission) so the location history could be generated properly.

*   **Total Task**

The total task counts both the Done & Ongoing tasks from that user on that specific date.

*   **Done Task**

The total amount of tasks that the user has finished on that specific date, the tracking page will show the finished task based on its Done time.

![](https://t3837933.p.clickup-attachments.com/t3837933/bb7a6472-6d02-4860-a25b-b5c46c6f0bc5/image.png)

1. **Task Title**

This is generated from the task title, if the task title is not mapped at the [flow configuration](https://web.mile.app/flow/flow) setting. We will show the flow name as the title of this done task information card.

2. **Assignee**

The name of the user that finishes this task.

3. **Task Status**

Status of this task. "Done" means the task has been finished.

4. **Task Content**

Customizable task content that could be mapped at the [flow configuration](https://web.mile.app/flow/flow) setting. If the value is empty or the task content is not mapped, this content won't be shown.

5. **Task Label**

Customizable task label that could be mapped at the [flow configuration](https://web.mile.app/flow/flow) setting. If the value is empty or the task content is not mapped, this label won't be shown.

6. **Task Address**

The task address will be displayed on this card if you map the routing configuration at the [flow configuration](https://web.mile.app/flow/flow) setting. If the value is empty or the task content is not mapped, this address won't be shown.

7. **Planned ETA**

Planned ETA is the estimated arrival time that is generated from the [route optimization](https://web.mile.app/route/visit) process, only the task that is optimized and dispatched from the [routing result](https://web.mile.app/route/result) will have this value. If you didn't optimize the task this value won't be shown.

8. **Planned ETD**

This value is similar to the Planned ETA value, it will always display in pair because the Planned ETD is the estimated departure time that is also generated from the [route optimization](https://web.mile.app/route/visit) process. If you didn't [optimize and dispatch](https://web.mile.app/route/result) the task this value won't be shown.

9. **Arrival Time**

Arrival Time is the actual time when the user arrives at the task location, this data will be sent automatically from the user's mobile app.

10. **Depart Time**

Depart Time is the actual time when the user finishes the task, this data will be sent automatically from the user's mobile app.

## Ongoing Task Icon
The Ongoing Task icon will display plenty of information about the ongoing task, the icon will show you the location of the ongoing task.

Beside that you could also hover the icon for

### Ongoing Task that is Dispatched from the Route Optimization
When you hover over the Ongoing Task icon that is dispatched from the route optimization. A tooltip will appear that will show you the estimated arrival time of this user, and if the user is estimated to be late at their next task location, we will show the estimation of how much is the delay.

This tooltip will appear if these two requirements are fulfilled:
*   The task has been optimized and dispatched from the [route optimization](https://web.mile.app/route/visit) menu.
*   The user location history is updated, or the [Start Finish feature](https://web.mile.app/setting/permission) is active for that user so the user location history and time are recorded properly.

If those two conditions are fulfilled, new information will be generated for this Ongoing task icon, and you could see this tooltip when you hover over the Ongoing Task icon:

![](https://t3837933.p.clickup-attachments.com/t3837933/da03beaa-cf89-4544-9547-2d5ea543a32f/image.png)
*   **ETA**

_Example from the picture above: ETA 14:25_

This ETA will show you the **estimated arrival time of the user to this task location,** the calculation is based on the Last Update location of the user and the travel time that they need to reach this task location from their latest location history.

*   **Delay Estimate**

_Example from the picture above: (+5 mins)_

This information will **only be displayed if the user is estimated to be late to reach their next task location compared to the ETA** that is generated from the route optimization process.

For example: if the user is expected to be late 5 minutes compared to their ETA time, the tooltip will show the extra information (+5 mins).

But, if the user is expected to reach their next location within the ETA or earlier than the ETA, this extra information won't be displayed.

### Ongoing Task that is Not Optimize at Routing
If you hover above the Ongoing Task icon that is not optimized in the Routing menu, a tooltip will appear that will show you the estimated arrival time of this user. The ETA is calculated based on the user's last update location and the location of the next task in the queue.

![](https://t3837933.p.clickup-attachments.com/t3837933/027a6a5c-ac2f-4904-8ac7-c60e93952bca/image.png)
**ETA,** _Example from the picture above: ETA 07:20_
This ETA will show you the **estimated arrival time of the user to this task location,** the calculation is based on the Last Update location of the user and the travel time that they need to reach this task location from their latest location history.

This feature enhances task management by providing users with valuable ETA predictions for tasks that are not been optimized within the routing menu. This feature will enable better decision-making, more transparency for your customer, improved customer service, and resource optimization, ultimately contributing to more efficient and effective task execution.

This feature is also compatible to calculate mixed task; which is a combination of task that is not Optimized at Routing, and task that is Optimized through the Routing menu seamlessly.

For example, see the picture below:
![](https://t3837933.p.clickup-attachments.com/t3837933/721f1131-76df-43b9-9a89-350183218123/image.png)
**A.** This is the last updated location history of the Field user.
**B.** This is the "next task location"; we get the user's ETA to this location by calculating the time the user needs to reach the next task location from their last updated location.
**C.** To calculate the task ETA after the "next task location"; we will calculate the time that is needed to get to the next task from the previous task location. We will repeat this calculation indefinitely as needed. For example, if you have 50 Tasks, this process is repeated for each task.

### Ongoing Task Information Card
Beside the extra information when you hover on the Ongoing Task icon, you could click the icon and view the information card. The structure of the Ongoing Task information card is:

If you didn't optimize the task this value won't be shown.

8. **ETD**

This value is similar to the ETA value, it will always be displayed in pair because the ETD is the estimated departure time that is also generated from the [route optimization](https://web.mile.app/route/visit) process. If you didn't [optimize and dispatch](https://web.mile.app/route/result) the task this value won't be shown.

## Start Finish Icon
The Start Finish Icon information will be generated if the [Start Finish feature](https://web.mile.app/setting/permission) is active for the User's Role. This information consists of the Start location & time, the Finish location & time, also the total time and the total distance on that Start Finish session.

1. Repeat cycle type.
2. **Schedule Active Duration**: The schedule will only be active within the defined "Active From" and "Active To" dates. For example, if the "Active From" date has not yet started, the schedule won't be triggered automatically. Similarly, if the "Active To" date has passed, no further tasks will be generated because the active duration is no longer valid.
3. **Hours Selection**: Set the specific time of day when this schedule will be activated, and the task will be created.
4. **Add Hour**: You can add multiple activation times within the same day, allowing the schedule to trigger tasks at various hours throughout the day.

# Repeat Weekly

The **Weekly Schedule** option allows the schedule to repeat every week, on specific days and at specific times, or on multiple days and times.

![](https://t3837933.p.clickup-attachments.com/t3837933/70128265-88bb-4f1c-b335-fe81dedcfc69/image.png)

For example, if the "Active From" date has not yet started, the schedule won't be triggered automatically. Likewise, if the "Active To" date has passed, tasks will no longer be generated because the active duration has ended.
3. **Days & Hours Selection**: Set the specific day(s) and time(s) of the week when this schedule will be activated, and the tasks will be created.
4. **Add Time**: You can add multiple activation days and times within the week, allowing the schedule to trigger tasks on various days at specified times.

# Repeat Monthly

The **Monthly Schedule** option allows the schedule to repeat every month, on specific days and times, or on multiple days at specified times.

![](https://t3837933.p.clickup-attachments.com/t3837933/1777be66-2a2f-4ef9-82d9-3ab205bdba54/image.png)

1. Repeat type
2. **Schedule Active Duration**: The schedule will only be active within the "Active From" and "Active To" dates. If the "Active From" date has not started, the schedule won’t be triggered automatically. Similarly, if the "Active To" date has passed, tasks will no longer be generated as the active duration has ended.
3. **Days & Hours Selection**: Set the specific day(s) and time(s) of the month when this schedule will be activated, and tasks will be created.
4. **Add Time**: You can add multiple activation days and times within the month, allowing the schedule to trigger tasks on various days at specified times.

# Repeat by Date

The **Repeat Schedule by Date** option allows you to create a schedule that repeats on specific dates and times.

![](https://t3837933.p.clickup-attachments.com/t3837933/afc4ea43-683f-470f-836f-b42d358d4594/image.png)

# Route Optimization



# Introduction to Route Optimization

![](https://t3837933.p.clickup-attachments.com/t3837933/083b965c-4a5e-45da-8fcf-7cf8610e230a/image.png)
_Routing Result in MileApp_

[**Route Optimization**](https://web.mile.app/route/visit) is MileApp's key feature that lets you plan the most efficient route for your field users.
With this feature, you're equipped with a powerful tool to enhance your field operations. Say goodbye to inefficient routes, unnecessary costs, and wasted time. Start optimizing your routes today and experience the benefits of streamlined and efficient field operations.
Our route optimization engine is based on the [Travelling Salesman Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_salesman_problem) algorithm, where iteration is done to find the minimum distance using the least number of vehicles within the given parameter.
## Available Parameters
The routing parameter is defined as the available configuration for the routing engine to take into consideration to give the best result.
You can use several routing parameters; each parameter can be configured in either a visit vehicle or a routing configuration.
Each parameter is either a hard or soft constraint; hard constraint means the resulting solution will not cross this parameter, while soft constraint means the resulting solution may cross this parameter if it cannot find a feasible solution.

| **Parameter** | **Explanation** | **Configure in** | **Type** |
| ---| ---| ---| --- |
| Time window | This defines the range of time in the day when a visit can be visited | Visit | Hard constraint |
| Visit time | This parameter specifies how long the visit is in minutes | Visit | Hard constraint |
| Tag | This parameter will let visits use vehicles with the same tag | Visit, vehicle | Hard constraint |
| Capacity constraint | This parameter defines what kind of capacity each visit has and the minimum and maximum capacity each vehicle has. | Visit, vehicle | Minimum - soft constraint, maximum - hard constraint |
| Working time | This parameter defines the time in a day when the vehicle can work. | Vehicle | Hard constraint |
| Cost factor | This parameter defines the priority of the vehicle to be used based on its cost factor (0-100), with 0 as the highest priority and 100 as the lowest priority | Vehicle | Hard constraint |
| Auto speed | if set to true, the engine will determine the vehicle speed based on historical data<br>if set to false, the user can determine the speed of each vehicle and the default speed (in km/h) | Vehicle, Routing Configuration | Hard Constraint |
| Return to hub | If set to true, this parameter will provide a solution where the vehicle needs to return to the hub before the working time ends.<br>If set to false, the vehicle must finish the last visit before the working time ends. | Routing configuration | Hard constraint |
| Multi-trip | If set to true, the system will let the vehicle to be able to return to the hub to reset the vehicle capacity; this will let each vehicle have more than one trip in a day. | Routing configuration | Soft constraint |
| Clustering | If set to true, the optimization result will try to minimize the area overlapping between vehicles. | Routing configuration | Soft constraint |
| Use all vehicle | If set to true, the result will try to use all the vehicles available instead of finding the minimum number of vehicle | Routing configuration | Soft constraint |
| Auto split | If set to true, whenever there is a visit with more capacity than the maximum capacity on the matching tags, the system will split the visit into two or more visits so that it can be fitted into one or more trucks. | Routing configuration | Soft constraint |
| Auto merge | if set to true, whenever there is more than one visit with the exact latitude and longitude present, it will considered as one visit so that the solution doesn't place these visits in different vehicles | Routing configuration | Soft constraint |
| Grouped Visit and Priority | Visits assigned to the exact vehicle will be placed accordingly and ordered by priority. A lower number indicates a higher priority. | Visit | Hard constraint |

### **Time Window**
This parameter defines when a visit can and should be visited,
In most cases, time windows are often used to specify the timeframe for a shipment or delivery to arrive or be picked up before it closes. Time windows help ensure logistics operations run smoothly and efficiently by providing clear expectations and reducing uncertainty.
For example, if an outlet opens at 8 AM and closes at 5 PM, the delivery may be scheduled to arrive between these times by setting up the visit open time at 8 AM and visit close time at 5 PM.
This can be set in **routing > visit** menu :
![](https://t3837933.p.clickup-attachments.com/t3837933/f5875fd1-0e82-4b97-8042-5595669b727d/image.png)
This will ensure that the routing result will have the outlets visited by your available vehicle only between these times.
### **Visit time**
This parameter defines the time it takes for a vehicle to wait at each visit before departing to the next destination; it can also be called **unloading time** because, usually, in most cases, it is the time taken to unload goods from the vehicle.
This can be set up in **Routing > Visit** menu :
![](https://t3837933.p.clickup-attachments.com/t3837933/51ca3a93-52e1-4918-90e3-c8b825d52079/image.png)
### **Tag**
The tag parameter indicates which vehicle needs to be used for the visit; the routing system will find the result in which that visit and vehicle have the same tag.
#### Use case: road class
The most common tag use case of the tag parameter is road class, where each visit is tagged depending on what type of vehicle can pass that road to that specific visit.
![](https://t3837933.p.clickup-attachments.com/t3837933/b7e9c5c1-cf5e-4bb5-8c99-21b85fe2aa5f/image.png)
The picture above illustrates that we can classify the visit tag depending on the road size **(small, medium, big)** and that the vehicles are given corresponding tags.
#### Use case: dedicated vehicle
Another common use case of tag parameter is the **dedicated** vehicle case; for example, if you have several vehicles dedicated to collecting cash on delivery, these vehicles can have "**COD"** as a tag, and the visits that require cash collection on delivery can use the same tag.
### **Capacity Constraint**
Capacity is a critical factor in logistics, as it determines the ability of the logistics provider to meet customer demand, fulfill orders, and deliver products on time.
MileApp lets you use up to 10 capacity constraints; some of the commonly used capacity constraints are:
*   Weight
*   Volume
*   Packs
*   Boxes
*   Frozen-weight
*   Chilled-weight
Capacity can be measured in various units, such as weight, volume, or number of items, depending on the nature of the products being transported or stored.
You first need to set capacity constraint configuration along with the unit in the **Routing > Configuration** menu:
![](https://t3837933.p.clickup-attachments.com/t3837933/f5bd0646-e81d-4344-9be0-cbbc5f1ec6ab/image.png)
Once the configuration is set, you will be able to set the maximum and minimum capacity each vehicle can take; while the maximum parameter is a hard constraint, which means the optimization result will not cross this rule, the minimum parameter instead is a soft constraint, where our optimization engine will cross the rule if no feasible result is found
You can set this in **Routing > Vehicle** menu on each vehicle:
![](https://t3837933.p.clickup-attachments.com/t3837933/d2240e91-6f0c-4f25-afbc-2ffcb5499956/image.png)
Each visit will then have its capacity accordingly; if nothing is filled in the visit menu, it equates to 0
You can set this in **Routing > Visit** menu on each visit:
![](https://t3837933.p.clickup-attachments.com/t3837933/92bc765f-0c1e-474d-9cad-64fb09b2c9a9/image.png)

Note: You can create more capacity constraints, but each hub is only allowed to select up to 10 constraints. The list of constraints will be the same across all hubs within your organization, but each hub can use different constraints.

### Working Time
Working time sets up the timeframe a vehicle can go with; this parameter doesn't let any visit be given outside the given timeframe. in the case where the parameter "return to hub" is set to true,
Users can also set the working time to be more than one day in cases where they want to plan for more than a day simultaneously
You can set this in **Routing > Vehicle** on each vehicle:
![](https://t3837933.p.clickup-attachments.com/t3837933/86a9cfd9-3b55-40a6-9fde-5b867db66197/image.png)
### Cost Factor
The cost factor parameter enables you to determine which vehicles are given priority; the cost factor defines the cost multiplier for each vehicle. for example, if vehicle A has the cost factor 1 and vehicle B has the cost factor set to 10, then the cost to deliver using vehicle B is ten times the cost for vehicle B
This parameter is useful when you have your internal vehicle and use an additional vehicle from the vendor; in this case, you can set your internal vehicle to have a cost factor of 0 and the ones from a vendor to be 10. this will let the engine always fill your vehicle first before using the vendor's vehicle
You can set this in **Routing > Vehicle** on each vehicle:
![](https://t3837933.p.clickup-attachments.com/t3837933/20b5115b-06f0-40f5-9a42-37e67770d479/image.png)
### Auto Speed
Auto speed parameter, when turned on, will use the historical vehicle speed in the given area. we also let you fill the speed manually in km/h, in cases where you may want to consider slower or faster moving vehicle
You can set this at **Routing > Configuration**:
![](https://t3837933.p.clickup-attachments.com/t3837933/af1f73e1-4dcc-4903-a09e-9ebc10d76a3f/image.png)

Note: If Auto Speed is enabled, the speed field for each vehicle will be disabled.

### Return to Hub
Return to hub option make sure that each vehicle returns to the hub as the last leg of the trip; the return trip back to the hub will satisfy the condition of working time, which means if a vehicle's working time is 8 AM to 5 PM, it will return to the hub before 5 PM.
![](https://t3837933.p.clickup-attachments.com/t3837933/eb2924da-d353-48b1-87f1-49462251deaa/image.png)
With the latest enhancement, you can now specify whether vehicles should return to the hub **before** or **after** their working hours end. If this option is left unchecked, the vehicle will automatically return to the hub before the end of its working hours. This setting can also impact the routing results, as different routes may be generated depending on your choice.
If this parameter is false, the system will not have to return to the hub as part of the trip, and the trip will end on the last visit.

Note: This option will be automatically activated when the Multi Trip option is turned on.

### Multi Trip
Multi-trip enables a vehicle to return to the hub to reset its capacity constraint and start another trip.
![](https://t3837933.p.clickup-attachments.com/t3837933/7c099349-396b-4089-b0cc-2119bb35a390/image.png)
### Clustering
Clustering will let our engine group nearby visits together, minimizing overlapping between areas served between vehicles.

Without Clustering
![](https://t3837933.p.clickup-attachments.com/t3837933/170cc103-9d9d-448f-8949-835b93f2e753/image.png)

### Use All Vehicle
All vehicle options will let the optimization engine use all the available vehicles to get a result instead of finding the minimum number of vehicles required; this is useful in cases where you want all your vehicles to have an equal distribution of visits.
### Auto-Split
With Auto Split, the system will automatically split visits with a capacity of more than any single vehicle into several visits to generate results without dropping the large visit. This feature will only evaluate vehicles that have **matching tags** to determine if splitting is [required.Read](http://required.Read) more [here](https://doc.clickup.com/3837933/p/h/3n3zd-81962/aa00834626ae24f/3n3zd-191816) for details.
### Auto-Merge
With Auto Merge, orders with the exact coordinate will be put together in the exact vehicle and back-to-back order; this will prevent orders from the same customer from being put into different vehicles, which can happen in the optimization process. Read more [here](https://doc.clickup.com/3837933/p/h/3n3zd-81962/aa00834626ae24f/3n3zd-231736) for details.
### Visit Group
Similar to the tag system, when activated, visits with the same vehicle parameter will be grouped and assigned to the exact vehicle. Read more [here](https://doc.clickup.com/3837933/p/h/3n3zd-81962/aa00834626ae24f/3n3zd-245116).
## Flow configuration for routing parameter
Before using the routing system, we need to relate the flow component to a routing visit parameter; this can be found in the menu **Flow > Configuration > Route.**

![](https://t3837933.p.clickup-attachments.com/t3837933/c115343b-54c0-41b3-9101-b2307dbfe831/image.png)

Each visit parameter requires a corresponding input type from the flow; the input type for each parameter is given in the table below.

| **Routing key** | **Type of input component** |
| ---| --- |
| Visit name | Text |
| Address | Address |
| Open time | Time |
| Close time | Time |
| Visit Duration | Number |
| Coordinate | Coordinate |
| Tag | Text |
| Constraint | Number, Currency |

## Feature: Dynamic Routing
Dynamic routing ensures that routed visits remain with the same vehicle even after re-routing. If additional visits are added after optimization, previously routed visits will not be reassigned to different vehicles as they were in the earlier optimization. The package icon will be displayed next to the visit name as shown below:
![](https://t3837933.p.clickup-attachments.com/t3837933/7bf7c9a6-5ec4-4b9e-9c73-e276f99118fa/image.png)

# Visit

![](https://t3837933.p.clickup-attachments.com/t3837933/824a9999-be5d-4537-9062-879953de6f1f/image.png)
A Visit is a term used at MileApp to represent the destination of a field user. Visits can represent various activities, such as a delivery location, a pickup location, a home visit location, and more.
Visits are generated from Routable Tasks that have proper [Flow](https://web.mile.app/flow/flow) configurations. You can add a new Visit from the [Task](https://web.mile.app/tasks/task) menu.

# Visit Page

On the Visit page, you will see a list of active tasks. Active tasks are those with a status of either Ongoing or Unassigned. These tasks are ready for routing optimization, but you can still update some information related to the optimization.
![](https://t3837933.p.clickup-attachments.com/t3837933/509c4f15-33a5-465a-a7f6-0d93825c8b24/image.png)
Here's the detailed breakdown of each section:
1. **Map View**: This map displays all visit coordinates. The numbers indicate the visit order as shown on the left.
2. **Filter**: You can filter visits by typing a name or address. You can also filter by task status or flow name.
3. **Select All**: Use this toggle to select or unselect all visits. Unselected visits will not be included in the routing optimization process.
4. **Total Visit**: This shows the number of selected visits out of the total visits.
5. **Visit Name**: Displays the name of each visit.
6. **Coordinate Validation Indicator**: Ensure the pin icon is green. If it is not, it means our system failed to geocode the coordinates or they are in an incorrect format. To fix this:
    *   Input the coordinates manually using this format: latitude,longitude.
    *   Adjust the address to a more readable format to help our system geocode it successfully.
7. **Expand Visit**: Click the dropdown arrow to view and edit each visit's parameters. See this [section](https://doc.clickup.com/3837933/p/h/3n3zd-81962/aa00834626ae24f/3n3zd-83562) for more detail.
8. **Optimize Button**: Click this button when you are ready for routing optimization. If you do not have any vehicles, the Optimize button will not be shown. In that case, go to the "Vehicle" submenu to set up your vehicles.

_Routing Configuration Menu - Capacity Constraint_

Name, Address, and Coordinate are fundamental data for routing optimization. If these fields are not set up, the Name will display as "(not\_set)" as shown in the picture below, and the other fields will be empty. When you encounter this, you can manually input the data here before performing the optimization.

You can still perform routing optimization without configuring the flow first, but the values will not be saved into the task data. When you dispatch, the values will not be updated to the task data.

![](https://t3837933.p.clickup-attachments.com/t3837933/6fea20dd-c612-46c8-aaa5-7582438f8507/image.png)![](https://t3837933.p.clickup-attachments.com/t3837933/3fbb00e7-49c2-4c23-ae57-1557b03b54a9/image.png)

# Vehicle

The vehicle represents a car, bike, truck, or other transportation used in your organization. Field users can be assigned to a vehicle, and vehicles can also be configured with parameters such as working time, speed, and capacity constraints.

This section allows you to configure vehicles for routing optimization. The vehicles displayed are filtered based on the selected hub in the top right corner of the page.
![](https://t3837933.p.clickup-attachments.com/t3837933/1f7c6d18-d7f2-43c1-b07d-0b4d8b7993f9/image.png)
Here's the detailed breakdown of each section:

6. **Vehicle Name**: Displays the name of each vehicle.
7. **Delete**: Remove a specific vehicle from the list.
8. **Expand Vehicle Data**: Click to view detailed vehicle data. Here, you can update the vehicle's information as needed.

# How to Create a Vehicle

In this section, we will guide you on how to create a vehicle from the Vehicle Page.

Required Permission:
*   View Vehicle
*   Create Vehicle

![](https://t3837933.p.clickup-attachments.com/t3837933/3dfca999-a42c-4d9f-8245-f572ac22df60/image.png)
1. **Click the "New" button** to add a new vehicle.
2. **Load Sample Data**: Use this option to view an example of vehicle data.
3. **Fill in the Necessary Fields** for each vehicle.
When finished, click the Submit button to continue. The newly created vehicle will be active by default.
Below are detailed guidelines for each input:
1. **Name**. Input the vehicle's name, which can include identifiers like a police number (e.g., B 1234 SYZ).
2. **Assignee**. Select the user to be assigned to this vehicle, or leave this empty. You can assign the user later when routing is done.
3. **Working Time**. Specify the vehicle's daily working hours; if not, the default is 08:00 to 17:00. Empty vehicles adopt the working hours of others if specified. For more detail, please see the Working Time section below.
4. **Break Time**. Configure break time for the vehicle within the specified working start and end time. For more detail, please see the Break Time section below.
5. **Speed**. Define the vehicle's speed, ensuring it meets a minimum of 5 km/h. Note: this field will be disabled if you activate "Auto Speed" in the Configuration page.
6. **Cost Factor**. The Cost Factor value ranges from 0 to 100, with the default value set to 0. A lower number indicates a higher priority for routing optimization purposes.
7. **Vehicle Tags**. Use tags to pair visits with vehicles, optimizing routes by matching tags for efficient assignments. Ensure that one or more vehicle tags match the tags of the visit you wish to filter. Please refer to the scenarios below for more understanding:
    1. **Scenario 1**: If a vehicle has 2 tags ("a" and "b") while the visit has 3 tags ("a", "b", and "c"), then this visit will be dropped.
    2. **Scenario 2**: If a vehicle has 3 tags ("a", "b", and "c") while the visit also has 3 tags ("a", "b", and "c"), then this visit will be optimized.
    3. **Scenario 3**: If a vehicle has 4 tags ("a", "b", "c", and "d") while the visit has 3 tags ("a", "b", and "c"), then this visit will be optimized.
8. **Capacity Constraint**. Define the minimum and maximum capacity for each vehicle. The capacity is based on the selected capacity in the Routing/Configuration menu.
* * *
## Working Time
By **default**, the timeframe is set from **08:00** to **17:00**. However, users can adjust this according to their specific requirements. This parameter restricts any visits to occur within the specified timeframe. Empty vehicles, those without explicitly defined working hours, will adopt the working hours of other vehicles if specified.
Additionally, if the parameter "return to hub" is enabled, users have the option to set the working time for more than one day. This feature facilitates planning for extended periods, allowing users to simultaneously plan routes multiple days.
### Working Time Validation
When inputting working hours, ensure that the starting time precedes the ending time. Failure to adhere to this rule will prompt a validation message, guiding you to correct the error before proceeding.
![](https://t3837933.p.clickup-attachments.com/t3837933/058cee2b-016d-4cf5-891c-7cbeb395e499/image.png)
* * *
## Break Time
It's crucial to understand that when configuring breaks for multiday operations, the break schedule remains consistent across all days. For example, if the Working Time spans from 07:00 to 17:00 with an additional day, and the Break Time is set from 12:00 to 13:00, the vehicle will take a break from 12:00 to 13:00 each day.
For a comprehensive understanding of how working time, break time, and multiday settings interact, consider the following scenarios:
*   If the **break start time falls after the end of the working time**, the optimization will **fail**. For example:
    *   Working Time: 19:00 - 05:00 +1 day (7:00 PM - 5:00 AM)
    *   Break Time: 06:00 - 07:00 (6:00 AM - 7:00 AM)
*   If the **break occurs within the working time**, the optimization will **succeed**. For example:
    *   Working Time: 19:00 - 05:00 +1 day (7:00 PM - 5:00 AM)
    *   Break Time: 00:00 - 01:00 (12:00 AM - 1:00 AM)
*   If the **break start time precedes the start of the working time**, the optimization will **fail**. For example:
    *   Working Time: 19:00 - 05:00 +1 day (7:00 PM - 5:00 AM)
    *   Break Time: 18:00 - 19:00 (6:00 PM - 7:00 PM)
### Break Time Validation
Similar to working time validation, ensure that the break start time precedes the break end time to avoid any validation errors.

# Configuration

Configuration involves defining the parameters and inputs that the system will use to calculate the optimal route. By carefully configuring the routing optimization system, you can ensure it is tailored to your specific needs and can produce the best possible results.

Within a configuration, you will find the following settings:
![](https://t3837933.p.clickup-attachments.com/t3837933/62987a8a-3dac-4534-8066-417898fab469/image.png)
_Routing Configuration page_
1. **Filter Hub**. Each configuration is unique to its hub.
2. **Auto Speed and Default Speed**.
    *   When unchecked, you can define the default speed manually.
    *   If you choose to use auto speed, it will automatically adjust based on historical data.
3. **Default Visit Time**.
    *   Specifies the duration required for a worker to complete a task in one visit if not specified in the visit data.
    *   Additionally, there is a dynamic visit time based on the selected capacity. Read more [here](https://doc.clickup.com/3837933/p/h/3n3zd-81962/aa00834626ae24f/3n3zd-233076).
4. **Other Configuration**. Read more [here](https://doc.clickup.com/3837933/p/h/3n3zd-81962/aa00834626ae24f/3n3zd-82222) for a detailed understanding of each configuration option.
5. **Capacity Constraint**.
    *   Add a new variable that can be used to constrain each optimization.
    *   This constraint will be persistent across all hubs in your organization, but each hub can customize which constraints are checked or used.
6. **Geotagging**. Read more [here](https://doc.clickup.com/3837933/p/h/3n3zd-81962/aa00834626ae24f/3n3zd-236956) for details.
For more details on each parameter, please refer to this [documentation](https://doc.clickup.com/3837933/p/h/3n3zd-81962/aa00834626ae24f/3n3zd-82222).
## Managing Routing Configuration Profiles
Managing routing configuration profiles allows you to customize and optimize routing setups for different needs without repeatedly adjusting settings. You can have multiple profiles for each hub, with no maximum limit. This allows you to set up different configurations for various routing scenarios.
### **Profile Creation and Editing**
Use the "Save as Profile" button to create a new profile. Enter a unique name for the profile when prompted.
![](https://t3837933.p.clickup-attachments.com/t3837933/fde8d6b3-3ee4-44bd-9c48-ba9dafff7018/image.png)
To rename a profile, click the edit icon next to the profile name in the Profile Manager dialog.
![](https://t3837933.p.clickup-attachments.com/t3837933/2c389025-0dc6-44f5-a413-de538cd18043/image.png)
### **Profile Deletion**
Click the delete icon next to the profile name in the Profile Manager dialog. Confirm the deletion in the pop-up dialog. **Note** that you cannot delete the last remaining profile in the hub.
![](https://t3837933.p.clickup-attachments.com/t3837933/9fa74858-0b74-432b-ae51-e91d2bfc4e67/image.png)
### **Profile Selection**
Select from existing profiles using the dropdown. If no profile is created, the "Default Profile" is selected by default.
![](https://t3837933.p.clickup-attachments.com/t3837933/95be14e8-15ea-450c-8596-0fe492a7d2c7/image.png)

Profiles are optional. You can still optimize routing even if no profile is set; in such cases, the Default Profile will be automatically selected.

## Optimize
If you have visits ready and all necessary configurations set, you can start the optimization process by clicking the "Optimize" button located below the vehicle list.![](https://t3837933.p.clickup-attachments.com/t3837933/928433eb-4c7a-47f3-a4a8-c957c6d2e387/image.png)
If no visits are available, the button will display "Input Visit" and redirect you to the Visit page.

# Cross Docking

This feature enhances your routing capabilities through **Sub Hubs**. This manual will guide you through the setup and usage of the Cross Docking feature.

![](https://t3837933.p.clickup-attachments.com/t3837933/2cf26133-c7f1-40e0-815f-bcc087afa124/image.png)
![](https://t3837933.p.clickup-attachments.com/t3837933/199eff06-f843-43c0-850b-8b3f53f4647f/image.png) ➝ Represent the location of the main hub.
![](https://t3837933.p.clickup-attachments.com/t3837933/6e87b0cc-2e8a-4d8c-a8c8-252d1121da42/image.png) ➝ Represent the location of the sub hub.
## Activating Cross Docking
To activate Cross Docking, follow these steps:
1. Go to the Routing/Configuration menu.
2. Check the "Cross Docking" checkbox.
3. Two Cross Docking types will be available:
    *   **Route all visits to sub hub:** Routes all visits through Sub Hubs before reaching the destination.
    *   **Route dropped visits only:** Routes unrouted visits to Sub Hubs, while direct delivery from the Main Hub is still possible.
4. The "Maximum Distance" option for vehicle sub hubs allows you to specify the maximum distance, in meters, that a vehicle can travel. If you don't want to set a maximum distance, leave this field empty.
    1. **Rules and Validation**:
        1. Rule: It's important to note that the maximum distance setting only affects vehicles stationed at sub-hubs. Vehicles originating from the main hub remain unaffected by this parameter.
        2. Validation:
            1. Upon initially checking the Maximum Distance checkbox, the input field defaults to an empty state, prompting you to enter a value.
            2. The minimum allowable value for Maximum Distance is set at **1000 meters**.

_Cross Docking option_
## Sub Hub Management
After activating the Cross Docking option, a feature to manage the Sub Hub will be available below. On this page, you can create, edit, and delete the Sub Hub, but you need to map the vehicles on the Routing/Vehicle page. Follow these steps:
### Creating Sub Hubs
1. Click the "Add sub hub" button to choose a hub.
2. Choose and configure up to 10 Sub Hubs

Only hubs within the same country as the active hub can be set as sub hubs.

### Mapping Vehicles to Sub Hubs
1. In the Routing/Vehicle menu, create or edit vehicle data.
2. In the top corner, you can choose to manage vehicle for main hub or sub hubs.
3. You can specify whether a vehicle is allowed to be routed to sub-hubs by selecting the option "**Allow this vehicle to be routed to a sub-hub**" Note that this option only applies when choosing the "Route dropped visits only" type of Cross Docking.

![](https://t3837933.p.clickup-attachments.com/t3837933/531eb270-996f-45c7-8f03-2fe1afa46cd1/image.png)

After successfully creating vehicle for the corresponding Main Hub and Sub Hub, a clear indicator the Sub Hub to which a vehicle belongs will appear on vehicle list.

![](https://t3837933.p.clickup-attachments.com/t3837933/5b59c7a5-aa01-4186-8b9d-1ac8d86c023d/image.png)
## Route Optimization

## Dispatching Visits
When clicking "Dispatch," the process of assignment will run in the background as we generate **additional tasks** from the Main Hub to Sub Hubs to facilitate order **handovers**. The number of tasks generated will depend on the count of routed visits to Sub Hubs. The additional tasks will include some relevant information such as "Handover From" (taken from the assignee vehicle), "Handover To" (user input), and "List Order" (task title).
When dispatching routing results with Cross Docking, remember:
*   Tasks routed to Sub Hubs will be moved accordingly.
*   In the Task menu, select the corresponding sub-hub in the right corner to view assignments.

# Auto Split

With Auto Split, the system will automatically split visits with a capacity of more than any single vehicle into several visits to generate results without dropping the large visit. This feature will only evaluate vehicles that have **matching tags** to determine if splitting is required.
## Activate the Auto Split
To activate Auto Split, follow these steps:
1. Go to the Routing/Configuration menu.
2. Check the "Auto Split" checkbox.
3. Two split types will be available:
    *   Split capacity equally
    *   Maximize vehicle capacity. Note: Only the first defined capacity will be considered in the routing optimization process.
![](https://t3837933.p.clickup-attachments.com/t3837933/e52a7e03-f277-4597-9f94-613b61f085a8/image.png)
_Auto Split Configuration_
## Route Optimization
**Example using "Split capacity equally" type**:
![](https://t3837933.p.clickup-attachments.com/t3837933/c8b11397-4815-4f5d-936e-bdd1b29645b5/image.png)

_The second segment of the visit "Sven Arvidsson" in vehicle 2_
The routing result for the visit "Sven Arvidsson" has been split into two visits equally, with each visit having a capacity of 1750 out of the total 3500.

**Example using "Maximize vehicle capacity" type**:
![](https://t3837933.p.clickup-attachments.com/t3837933/1a65a638-0965-4d03-97f6-a5a88a4ffcd6/image.png)

_The second segment of the visit "Sven Arvidsson" in vehicle 2_
As depicted, the first segment will utilize the maximum capacity of the vehicle, 3000, while the remaining capacity, 500, will be allocated to the second segment.
## Exporting Data
When exporting data, the "Other" sheet will include information about the Auto Split type.
![](https://t3837933.p.clickup-attachments.com/t3837933/3705c597-9e51-48f0-9de5-f66f72cefc70/image.png)
## Dispatching Visits
Upon clicking "Dispatch," the system initiates background processing to assign tasks based on routing results. If a visit is split into multiple segments, a new task is generated for each segment, maintaining data integrity and ensuring accurate capacity allocation. The original task's capacity is updated accordingly to reflect the split.

**Important Note**:
1. It is **recommended** to configure the capacity constraint field with the component in the task from the Flow menu. Failure to do so may result in an empty capacity constraint in the Routing/Visit menu, which can be manually inputted later.

![](https://t3837933.p.clickup-attachments.com/t3837933/91725a1d-6b74-409a-9718-9bb41b3a9c02/image.png)

_Route Configuration in Flow/Configuration menu_

2. Upon dispatching, the detailed task will display information regarding the split type and split number. However, if the split visit is on the dropped list, it will retain the original task and remain "Unassigned."

![](https://t3837933.p.clickup-attachments.com/t3837933/d44374a6-e4d9-480f-a9e9-c46eb3b545de/image.png)

3. If you exceed your task quota, failed dispatches may occur, as a new task is generated based on the split number during dispatching.
4. When Auto Split is used in conjunction with the Auto Merge feature, identical coordinate visits will not be split across different vehicles.

# Auto Merge

With Auto Merge, orders with the exact coordinate will be put together in the exact vehicle and back-to-back order; this will prevent orders from the same customer from being put into different vehicles, which can happen in the optimization process.
## Activate the Auto Merge**:**
To activate Auto Merge, follow these steps:
1. Go to the Routing/Configuration menu.
2. Check the "Auto Merge" checkbox.

With Auto Merge activated, visits with identical coordinates will no longer be assigned to different vehicles, ensuring optimal resource utilization.

**Example**:
The visits named "Windsor Hansen" and "Jannes Everts" share the same coordinates (-6.562204079109113,106.80967540179249), indicating that they will be processed by the same vehicle:
![](https://t3837933.p.clickup-attachments.com/t3837933/463ba3ff-dc6a-4641-a843-809649490fbc/image.png)

![](https://t3837933.p.clickup-attachments.com/t3837933/0dcb8c23-f4ba-471c-95cd-88bd3d15d388/image.png)

It's important to note that the Auto Merge feature does not physically merge visits together. Instead, it ensures that visits with identical coordinates are not assigned to different vehicles.

When utilizing the Auto Merge feature in conjunction with Auto Split, visits with identical coordinates will not be split across multiple vehicles. This ensures that the integrity of the merged visits is maintained.

# Dynamic Visit Time

This feature enables you to customize visit times according to capacity constraints. By default, visit times are provided per visit in the Routing/Visit menu. However, if you prefer dynamic visit times based on capacity constraints, you can utilize this feature.
## Configure The Dynamic Visit Time
1. Navigate to **Routing/Configuration** menu
2. Look for the Default Visit Time input field.
3. Adjacent to this field, you will find the **Dynamic Visit Time** icon.

![](https://t3837933.p.clickup-attachments.com/t3837933/eb029ff9-98ac-4448-a99f-3f22d113f7fc/image.png)

4. Hover over the icon to view tooltip text for **guidance**.
5. **Click** on the Dynamic Visit Time icon to initiate configuration.
6. A **pop-up window** will appear, displaying checked capacity constraints.

![](https://t3837933.p.clickup-attachments.com/t3837933/bd4f4759-708a-4050-8043-b56db2b46b14/image.png)

7. **Define the visit time for each capacity constraint** according to your requirements.
8. If you do not wish to utilize a specific capacity constraint for routing optimization, you can either set its visit time to zero (**0**).
9. Once you have configured the dynamic visit times for capacity constraints, click the "**Submit**" button to save your changes.

*   If the per-visit visit time is unspecified, it will be calculated as the sum of the default visit time and dynamic visit time.
*   If both per-visit visit time and default visit time are specified, priority is given to the per-visit visit time.

# Geotagging

This configuration allows you to automatically assign visit tags based on geographic areas.
## How to Create a Geotag
1. **Navigate to the Routing/Configuration menu and scroll down to the Geotagging section.**
2. **Click on the + icon** to start creating a new tag.

![](https://t3837933.p.clickup-attachments.com/t3837933/7b537213-2335-4c64-81a5-d210d0383aaa/image.png)

3. **Enter the tag name**, for example, "Selatan". This name usually corresponds to a specific area. Note: The geotag name must be **unique** and cannot be duplicated.
4. **Click on the map icon** to start creating a polygon by dropping points on the map to outline the area.
5. **Click Submit** when you have finished defining the area.

![](https://t3837933.p.clickup-attachments.com/t3837933/d182508a-6476-4659-8821-676d86278fb7/image.png)

*   The list of geotags is specific to each **hub**. Whenever you change the filter hub in the top right corner, the geotag list will update accordingly.
*   If a visit already has a manually input tag, the geotag will be added to the existing visit tag.
*   When polygons overlap, a visit within the overlapping area will be tagged with all relevant geotags.

## Example
Once geotagging is set up, any visit within the defined area will automatically receive the corresponding tag. For instance, if you create a geotag named "Selatan" for the area below:
![](https://t3837933.p.clickup-attachments.com/t3837933/ed2bb50d-3f86-49a8-8285-fcaad513733d/image.png)
Any visit occurring at coordinates within this area will automatically be tagged as "Selatan" when you optimize routing.
![](https://t3837933.p.clickup-attachments.com/t3837933/e06a736e-2820-4d0f-863d-d708bd189362/image.png)

**Notes**: Before optimizing, you can select specific geotags to include in the route optimization.
![](https://t3837933.p.clickup-attachments.com/t3837933/95df547e-2b82-4509-924c-f79dbd6a9cd0/image.png)
## How to Edit Geotag
If you need to modify the area of a saved geotag, follow these steps:
1. Click on the map icon associated with the specific geotag you wish to edit.
![](https://t3837933.p.clickup-attachments.com/t3837933/2b18f45a-6688-4e29-b80b-776d548bd136/image.png)
1. A map will appear, displaying the current geotagged area. You can adjust this area in two ways:
    *   **Delete a Point:** Click on a point to remove it from the geotagged area.
    *   **Adjust a Point:** Drag a point to a new location to reshape the geotagged area.
By using these methods, you can easily update the geotag to accurately reflect the desired area.
When you have more than one geotag and you click to edit an area, other geotags will be visible and identifiable by their names:
![](https://t3837933.p.clickup-attachments.com/t3837933/413c60b2-927a-409c-8c1e-3051f345fd49/image.png)

# Visit Group

The Visit Group feature is designed to help you specify the sequence of visits in a specific order, such as ensuring pickups are completed before deliveries. Additionally, all visits within the same group are assigned to the **same vehicle**.
### Defining Visit Groups
You will find two new inputs: **Grouped Visit** and **Priority**:
![](https://t3837933.p.clickup-attachments.com/t3837933/39e642b7-b0c4-4f3b-b14b-95d9a380db5e/image.png)
1. **Visit Group**: This field allows you to assign visits to specific groups and ensure the same group is assigned to the same vehicle. Leave it empty if you want the routing to ignore visit grouping.
2. **Priority**: Specify the priority of visits within a group. The default priority is set to 0, with a range from 0 to 100. **A lower number indicates a higher priority**.
In the **Routing/Result** menu, visit group information is displayed similarly to visit tags but highlighted in red and positioned below the visit tags.

When exporting routing results to Excel, the Visit Group feature includes additional information:
*   **Per Vehicle Sheet**: New columns "Visit Group" and "Visit Priority" are included.

Note:
*   **Support for Multiple Visits**: The Visit Group feature supports not only two visits but also multiple visits.
*   **Sequential Execution**: While Visit Group Priority ensures visits are executed in the specified order within a group, it does not guarantee sequential execution. Other visits might be interleaved between sequential visits.
*   If you need to save the visit group in the task data, you must map it first in **Flow > Configuration > Route**. This ensures that when the dispatch routing result is sent, the visit group and priority are also included in the task data.

# Avoid Toll Roads

The **Avoid Toll Roads** setting allows you to exclude toll roads from the route optimization process.
When this setting is enabled, the system will calculate and recommend the most efficient route **without using toll roads**, helping you plan routes that fit your operational preferences or cost-saving needs.

Required Permission :
*   View configuration
*   Create configuration
*   Edit configuration

### **How to Activate Avoid Toll Roads**
1. Go to the **Routing → Configuration** menu.
2. Check the **“Avoid Toll Roads”** option.
Once activated, the route optimization will automatically exclude toll roads when generating routes.

You can disable this option anytime if you want the system to include toll roads again in future optimizations.

# Result

**Note**:
When you click "Restore" on the current version, it will not add another entry to the history, and the result will remain unchanged. Restoration only reverts the routing to a specific previous change. For example, if you have two history entries:
1. "2 visits moved to vehicle B by Owner" (this is the current version)
2. "Visit Place A moved to vehicle A by Owner"
If you click "Restore" on the second entry, it will cancel the latest change, meaning the visit "Place A" will be moved back to "vehicle A", reverting to the state of the routing at that specific change.
#### Reset Routing Result
If you need to revert your changes to the original state, simply click the "Reset" button. This will undo all modifications, and the reverted record will appear in the history results.
![](https://t3837933.p.clickup-attachments.com/t3837933/63613bd8-adfd-4f40-8313-ca5c576efae7/image.png)

### Vehicle
*   **Vehicle Optimized**: Displays the percentage of assigned vehicles versus unused vehicles. For example, `15/15 (100%)` means that all 15 vehicles have been assigned visits, resulting in 100% utilization.
*   **Visit Optimized**: Displays the percentage of routed visits versus unrouted visits. For example, `43/43 (100%)` means that all 43 visits have been routed into the vehicles, resulting in 100% optimization.
*   **Total Distance**: Displays the total distance covered by all assigned vehicles in kilometers. For example, `234 km`.
*   **Average Speed**: Displays the average speed of all assigned vehicles. If "Auto Speed" is selected in the configuration, it will show "auto".
### Time
*   **Total Travel Time**: Displays the total duration of all assigned vehicles. For example, `9h 51min` means the total travel time for all vehicles is 9 hours and 51 minutes.
*   **Total Visit Time**: Displays the total duration of all assigned vehicles when they arrive at visit locations, such as during handovers or unloading. For example, `36h 48min` means the total visit time for all vehicles is 36 hours and 48 minutes.
*   **Total Waiting Time**: Displays the total duration of all assigned vehicles before they can process tasks, such as when waiting for a store to open. The waiting time is related to the "Open Time" data per visit.
*   **Total Spent Time**: The sum of total travel time, total visit time, and total waiting time.
*   **Range of Finish Time**: The earliest to the latest finish time of all assigned vehicles. For example, `7:32 - 16:42` means the earliest finish time is 7:32 and the latest finish time is 16:42.
*   **Average Finish Time**: The average finish time of all assigned vehicles. For example, `10:05` means the average finish time is 10:05.
### Capacity
The capacity field is dynamic based on the configuration used. For example, `Total Weight 2,000 / 2,300 kg (86%)` means a total of 2,000 kg is optimized out of a maximum total of 2,300 kg across all vehicles, resulting in 86% optimization.
### Others

1. **Active Vehicle**. Displays the vehicle currently in use for the optimization. The box on the left side is uniquely colored for each vehicle, corresponding to the route color on the map view.
2. **Visit**. Shows the total number of visits assigned to each vehicle.
3. **Assignee**. Indicates the user assigned to the vehicle, typically the field user name. The available users in this list depend on the location of the route optimization, as it is based on the hub.
4. **Switch Vehicle.** Allows you to transfer all visits from one vehicle to another. Refer to the next section for more detail.
5. **Dropped.** Lists the visits that were not routed.
## Switch Vehicle
If you need to transfer all visits from one vehicle to another, you can use the "Switch Vehicle" feature. Ensure both vehicles have sufficient capacity for the transferred visits.
![](https://t3837933.p.clickup-attachments.com/t3837933/f6a02a40-92ca-4a13-885b-8d6f4b6308e3/image.png)

Important Note:
The switch will not validate the vehicle's working time or the vehicle's tag.

# Dropped Visit

The Dropped Visit displays visits that cannot be routed due to certain constraints or issues. Below are the potential reasons why a visit might appear on the Dropped List and guidance on how to address these issues:
![](https://t3837933.p.clickup-attachments.com/t3837933/86815eb6-eaf8-4630-a68c-970d7b8b0b96/image.png)![](https://t3837933.p.clickup-attachments.com/t3837933/70ce6453-87e3-4508-927a-5211e7b53ee9/image.png)
The reasons why a visit cannot be routed:
*   The visit's coordinates are outside valid ranges or incorrectly formatted. Verify that the latitude is between -90 and 90, and the longitude is between -180 and 180. Correct any errors in the coordinate values.
*   The visit's capacity requirement surpasses the maximum capacity of all available vehicles. Review the capacity constraints set for the visit and the vehicles. Ensure that there is a vehicle with sufficient capacity to accommodate the visit.
*   The visit's time window does not align with the working hours of any available vehicles. Check the open and close times for the visit and the working hours for the vehicles. Adjust the visit's time window or the vehicle's working hours to find a match.
*   The visit requires specific tags that none of the vehicles have. Ensure that the tags required for the visit are correctly assigned to at least one vehicle. Update either the visit's requirements or the vehicle's tags as needed.
#### Next Steps
After correcting the data issues, you can try rerouting the visit. Alternatively, you can manually move the visit from the Dropped list to a suitable vehicle.
#### Best Practices for Avoiding Dropped Visits
1. Validate Coordinates: Ensure all visit locations are accurately geocoded and validated for correctness.
2. Optimize Capacity Utilization: Balance visit requirements with vehicle capacities to avoid overloading.
3. Synchronize Time Windows: Align visit schedules with vehicle availability to ensure feasible routing.
4. Tag Management: Maintain consistent and accurate tagging of both visits and vehicles to ensure compatibility.

# Automation Type

Automation Type is the type of Action that would happen if the Automation is Triggered. Every Automation Type has its specific Automation Detail that contains the setting for the Action.

![](https://t3837933.p.clickup-attachments.com/t3837933/5b746d1c-247b-4a37-acd3-108f7d92fe4a/1.png)
1. Assign Task, this automation type enable you to assign a Task to a Field user
2. Move Task, this automation type enables you to move a Task to a certain Hub
3. Create Task automation type enable you to Create a Task based on your needs
4. Webhook automation type enables you to create a customize or advanced Action

# Assign Task

![](https://t3837933.p.clickup-attachments.com/t3837933/43def136-2031-4f9b-b742-761b92b5cab9/2.png)
If you pick Assign Task automation type (1), you have to choose the Hub & assign a Field user (2), if triggered, the Automation will be assigned a Task to that assigned user in that selected Hub.

In the example above, the Field user that was assigned is "mileapp", and the Field user's Task will be placed in the "Hub 1". So, a new Task that fit this Automation setting will be automatically assigned to "mileapp" in the "Hub 1".

# Move Task

![](https://t3837933.p.clickup-attachments.com/t3837933/bd23a5b1-9083-4e9f-8dd2-c4c376a370c8/3.png)
If you pick Move Task (1) automation type, you have to choose the Hub (2) destination, the Task will be moved to the Hub that is chosen if this type of Automation is triggered.

In the example above, the chosen Hub is "Hub 1", so when the Automation is triggered the Task will automatically move to "Hub 1" regardless of on which Hub it was created.

# Create Task

![](https://t3837933.p.clickup-attachments.com/t3837933/f873f9c0-f8a3-4783-8a5f-a763964c8d2e/4.png)
If you pick Create Task (1) automation type, you have to choose the Flow setting

You could Fill the Component of the Flow (2) with Text, or Refer to a component from the Trigger's Flow (3), or leave it empty because it was optional.

In the example above, the "Visit" Task will be Created by the Automation when a "Home Clean Service" Task is assigned, and in the "Visit" Task that was created, the "Receiver Name" will be filled with the "Order Number" from the "Home Clean Service" Task.

# Create or Update Data Source

The "Automation Type: Update Data Source" feature functions to ease the process of automatically updating data sources once tasks are completed.

![](https://t3837933.p.clickup-attachments.com/t3837933/002e8edb-706d-4c6b-a8fd-c0d2ca41f6b4/image.png)

The following steps will guide you in creating an automation:
1. Fill in the name for the automation you want to create.
2. Select the flow that will act as a trigger for the automation.
3. If necessary, add conditions to the form rules -> add condition.
4. Choose the "On Task Finished" event to use the "Update Data Source" automation type.
5. In the Automation Detail section, select the Data Source you want to use.
6. Choose the primary key that will serve as the condition for changing the data.
7. Next, set the values and fields that you want to change.
8. Finally, click the submit button to create the automation.

Tip: If you want to use the "Update Data Source" automation type, make sure you have created a data source and mapped it into the flow configuration. Learn more details here: [Data Source](https://doc.clickup.com/3837933/p/h/3n3zd-95902/1acc0fd538a5a2f)

# Create and Assign Task

The "Automation Type: Create and Assign Task" feature is designed to streamline the process of automatically creating and assigning a new task to a specified assignee.

![](https://t3837933.p.clickup-attachments.com/t3837933/77b68b61-9379-4e6c-a889-c1dcf72dd5a2/image.png)

The process of creating this type of automation is akin to other types. Begin by providing a name for the automation and defining the necessary rules. When selecting "Create and Assign Task" as the Automation Type, pay attention to the details in the Automation setup:
1. **Create Task**. Choose the workflow for the task to be automatically created.
2. **Hub**. Select the hub to which the task belongs.
3. **Initial Page**. Fill in the initial page details for the task.
4. After completing the Initial Page, you will encounter the "**Auto Assignment**" switch. This powerful feature allows you to automate task assignments based on various criteria, such as 'done by,' 'assigned by,' or 'assigned' users.
5. **Assignee**. This step determines who will be responsible for completing the task.

The options in the Assignee dropdown depend on the 'Auto Assignment' toggle. If you don't activate the 'Auto Assignment' toggle, you can manually designate an Assignee according to the user you want to assign. If you activate it, you can assign tasks based on 'done by,' 'assigned by,' or 'assigned' users. This step determines who will be responsible for completing the task.

![](https://t3837933.p.clickup-attachments.com/t3837933/3d14859f-7b93-4d52-9aa7-2dcadda0133b/image.png)

# Webhook

Webhooks are automated messages sent from web/apps when something happens, and are sent to a unique URL. If you have a specific activity that would be processed outside of MileApp web, you could use the Webhook automation type to do that.

A Webhook action will notify the system that you prefer, which could lead to a custom action based on your needs, such as updating a dashboard, triggering a process, etc.

Webhook is a method that's commonly used by IT Engineers, so if you need to set up one, it is highly advised to ask your IT Division or Developer to help you setup a proper one.

# Data Source

The data feature could help you simplify the process of filling in task information based on existing data at MileApp. This data could consist of information such as name, number, date, coordinate, and multiple options.

You can access this feature on the [Data](https://web.mile.app/data/data-list) page. The data is consist of 2 sub-pages, Data, and Type.

## Type
Type is a menu that allows you to specify the data structure that will be utilized in the Data menu.

Here, you can set the data type to suit your needs.
![](https://t3837933.p.clickup-attachments.com/t3837933/b9e8b241-c583-4fac-9ba1-7bb3a46753d3/image.png)
1. The name of the data type
2. Data sources can be restricted to be accessed only by selected users
3. If enabled, the data source can be used by a single organization. If disabled, the data source is unique per hub.
4. Type of title field
5. The type of data
6. The field type can be adjusted to mandatory or optional using a toggle.
7. The field can be set to appear directly in the table if enabled
8. Additional information about the field (a tooltip will display in the data menu on the field description)
9. You can add a field by clicking the text

Types created can be used immediately in the data menu.
![](https://t3837933.p.clickup-attachments.com/t3837933/47598b38-c95b-4568-aa12-5c74f4076c6d/image.png)
## Data
Data is created based on the structure of the data type that you have created.

## Create data based on the newly formed type

![](https://t3837933.p.clickup-attachments.com/t3837933/946af939-64f8-48b2-8e80-ee7a45ccae2c/image.png)

This is an example of Data based on the structure of the type that consists of a Primary key, 2 text fields, and 1 coordinate field. The data will be customizable based on your needs, you could add more than 1 custom field to make it easier for you to fill in Task information.

## Configure Flow to Use Data
You should set up a Flow to use this data in your task. After you create a flow or use an existing one, you could configure to use the Data by setting up the Data Source at the Flow Configuration.

1. Choose the data type that you want to use on this flow
2. Map the data based on the flow that you have created. Note that the Primary Key is required as it would be the trigger that will autofill the information on the Task. You could use Text Component for the Primary Key.

![](https://t3837933.p.clickup-attachments.com/t3837933/20608e91-7b23-434b-823e-18e3a53834a1/image.png)

Once you set it up properly the Mobile App preview will have the Search icon on the input field, as shown below:
![](https://t3837933.p.clickup-attachments.com/t3837933/f701a6cb-be75-4f2e-97a8-273df8c20b2b/image.png)

## Use Data to Autofill Task Information
You could use the Data to fill in the task information on 3 different methods:
*   Single task input
*   Bulk task input
*   Task input on the mobile app

### Single task input

# External Data Source

External Data Sources enable MileApp to seamlessly integrate with external systems, allowing you to synchronize real-time data from external databases, web services, and business applications.

By leveraging External Data Sources, you can maintain a single source of truth across multiple systems, automate data synchronization, and create dynamic workflows that respond to changes in your external systems in real-time.

## Overview

### What are External Data Sources?

External Data Sources are data types that pull information from external APIs rather than storing data within MileApp. When configured, these sources automatically fetch and validate data from external systems, making it available throughout your MileApp workflows just like regular data types. The data remains in your source system while being accessible across tasks, flows, and automations.

### Key Benefits

*   **Real-time Data Synchronization**: Always work with the latest data from your external systems
*   **Eliminate Data Duplication**: No need to maintain the same data in multiple systems
*   **Reduced Manual Entry**: Automatically pull customer, product, or location data from existing systems
*   **Enhanced Data Accuracy**: Single source of truth reduces errors from manual data entry
*   **Dynamic Updates**: Changes in external systems are immediately reflected

### Common Use Cases

*   **Product Catalogs**: Sync product information from e-commerce platforms or inventory systems
*   **Customer Databases**: Pull customer details from CRM systems like Salesforce or HubSpot
*   **Location Services**: Integrate with geocoding services or location databases
*   **Pricing Systems**: Fetch dynamic pricing from external pricing engines
*   **Inventory Levels**: Real-time stock levels from warehouse management systems
*   **Order Management**: Connect with order processing systems for delivery details

## Getting Started

### Accessing External Data Sources

1. Navigate to the [Data](https://web.mile.app/data/data-list) page from the main navigation menu
2. Click on the **Data Type** sub-tab to manage data type configurations
3. Look for data types marked with the purple **EXTERNAL** badge
4. External Data Sources are managed the same way as regular data types, but with additional configuration options

### Understanding the Interface

![](https://t3837933.p.clickup-attachments.com/t3837933/0395f213-e07a-4488-89f6-ec940b3c1d7b/image.png)

The External Data Source interface consists of:

1. **External Source Toggle**: Switch to enable/disable external API integration
2. **Configuration Panel**: Additional settings for the External endpoint and API key
3. **Test Connection**: Button to validate the external API configuration

### Basic Concepts

Before creating an External Data Source, understand these key concepts:

*   **API Endpoint**: The \[GET\] URL where your external data resides (e.g., `https://api.example.com/v1/products`)
*   **API Key**: The API Token (sent as an Authorization Bearer header)
*   **Field Mapping**: Matching external API fields to the data type structure
*   **Response Structure**: Expected format of data returned by the API (JSON)

## Creating an External Data Source

### Step 1: Create New Data Type

1. Navigate to **Data Source → Data Type**
2. Click **"New"**
3. Enter the basic information, such as data type name, add fields, etc.

![](https://t3837933.p.clickup-attachments.com/t3837933/458fdcc1-5d08-4907-8614-ab22fbd09cb2/image.png)

### Step 2: Enable External Source

1. Toggle the **"Use External Data Source"** switch to enable external API integration
    *   **Note**: Once a data type is created, this toggle for enabling the external data source cannot be changed
    *   For existing data types, this toggle will be disabled

### Step 3: Configure External API

![](https://t3837933.p.clickup-attachments.com/t3837933/72858a01-3932-490a-94b4-5ed95a4ed5c9/image.png)

Configure the external API settings:

#### Required Configuration

| Field | Description | Example |
| ---| ---| --- |
| **API URL** | Full \[GET\] endpoint URL | `https://api.storexyz.com/api/v2/stores` |

#### Optional Configuration

| Field | Description | Example |
| ---| ---| --- |
| **API Key** | Bearer token for authentication | `sk_live_abc123xyz789` |

### Step 4: Define Field Structure

1. Define the fields expected from your external API:

![](https://t3837933.p.clickup-attachments.com/t3837933/168f5a48-9294-4707-b336-5bca1e39189e/image.png)

For each field, configure:
*   **Field Title**: Human-readable name displayed in MileApp
*   **Field ID**: Machine-readable identifier (camelCase version of title)
*   **Field Type**: Select from:
    *   Primary Key (one required)
    *   Text
    *   Number
    *   Option
    *   Date
    *   Coordinate (geolocation)
    *   Phone Number
    *   Time
    *   Date Time
*   **Required**: Toggle if field must be present
*   **Show in Table**: Display in data listings
*   **Description**: Help text for users (shows as tooltip)

**Important**:
*   Empty field names are automatically filtered out during validation
*   At least one field must be marked as Primary Key
*   Field IDs should match or be similar to external API field names (key) for automatic mapping
*   These are the required system fields (System fields are required to properly process your data. These fields must be included in every record returned by your external API.) :
    1. \_id → required for unique id -> auto generated by external api system
    2. dataId → required → for representing the data when creating a task with the data source config turned on
    3. hubId → required → used for getting data that is limited by hub
        1. NOT Required if the data type is turned on `Common data in all hubs`
    4. data\_type.name

### Step 5: Validate Connection

1. Click **"Validate"** button to test your configuration:

![](https://t3837933.p.clickup-attachments.com/t3837933/22b3d539-67d0-4bc0-afa4-445237b491e7/image.png)

The validation process checks:
*   ✅ **Connection Test**: API endpoint is reachable
*   ✅ **Authentication**: Bearer token is valid
*   ✅ **Response Format**: Valid JSON returned
*   ✅ **Field Validation**: Compares expected vs actual fields

When any required system fields or user-defined fields are missing, a Structure Mismatch pop-up will appear.
![](https://t3837933.p.clickup-attachments.com/t3837933/c89786f1-af0a-486d-8326-ab39e07d6c4a/image.png)

### Step 6: Submit and Activate

1. After successful validation, click **"Submit"** to create the External Data Source
2. The system will perform an initial connection test
    1. If you attempt to submit with any missing fields, a pop-up confirmation will appear. You can proceed, but some fields may not populate correctly.![](https://t3837933.p.clickup-attachments.com/t3837933/2006498c-e22b-40d6-9fc2-4c24e0413e4b/image.png)
3. Once successful, the data type is ready for use in flows and tasks

### Editing Configuration

To modify an External Data Source:

1. Click the **Edit** icon on the data type
2. **Important**: The "Use External Data Source" toggle cannot be changed after creation
3. Update API URL, API Key, or field mappings as needed
4. **Always** test connection after making changes
5. Save to apply updates

**Warning**: Changing field mappings may affect existing flows using this data source. Test thoroughly before saving.

### Deleting External Sources

To remove an External Data Source:

1. Ensure no active flows depend on this data type
2. Navigate to Data Type list
3. Click **Delete** from the actions menu
4. Confirm deletion (this action cannot be undone)
5. System will remove the data type configuration

**Note**: Deletion only removes the configuration in MileApp. Your external data remains unchanged.

5. The system will remove the data type configuration

**Note**: Deletion only removes the configuration in MileApp. Your external data remains unchanged in the source system.

## API Requirements and Implementation Details

### Required API Endpoints

Based on MileApp's standard API structure, external systems should provide endpoints similar to:

1. **Get All Data**: `GET /api/data`
    *   Supports pagination parameters: `page`, `limit`
    *   Supports filtering: `fields`, `sortBy`, `sortOrder`
    *   Returns paginated list of records
2. **Get by ID**: `GET /api/data/{id}`
    *   Returns single record by unique identifier
3. **Get by Data Type and Data ID**: `GET /api/data/{dataType}/{dataId}`
    *   Returns specific record within a data type
4. **Get by Data ID**: `GET /api/data/by-data-id/{dataId}`
    *   Returns record by data identifier

### Query Parameters Support

External API endpoints, especially the "get all data" endpoint, should accept standard query parameters:

*   `page`: Page number for pagination (default: 1)
*   `limit`: Number of records per page (default: 20)
*   `fields`: Comma-separated list of fields to return
*   `sortBy`: Field name for sorting
*   `sortOrder`: Sort direction (`asc` or `desc`)
*   `search`: Search query string
*   `filter`: Additional filtering criteria

### Authentication

The API Key is sent as an Authorization Bearer token in the request header:

```css
Authorization: Bearer {api_key}
```

### Response Format

External APIs should return data in the following JSON structure:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": [
    {
      "_id": "unique_identifier",
      "dataId": "data_identifier",
      "hubId": "hub_identifier",
      "data_type": {
        "name": "type_name"
      },
      // Additional custom fields
    }
  ],
  "meta": {
    "total": 100,
    "page": 1,
    "per_page": 20,
    "last_page": 5
  }
}
```

## Important Considerations and Limitations

### Data Access Restrictions

For External Data Types, the Data Source menu provides **read-only** access:
*   No creation of new records through MileApp interface
*   No modification of existing records
*   No deletion capabilities
*   All data management must be performed in the external system

### Mobile App Considerations

There are specific limitations for external data sources in mobile applications:

1. **Offline Mode**: External data sources do not support offline mode due to dependency on real-time API connectivity

### Implementation Flow Considerations

When implementing external data sources, consider the workflow sequence:

1. **Option A: MileApp-First Approach**
    *   Create the data type structure in MileApp first
    *   Develop the external API to match the defined structure
    *   Benefit: Clear specification for API development
2. **Option B: API-First Approach**
    *   Develop the external API with required fields
    *   Configure MileApp data type to match existing API
    *   Benefit: Leverage existing APIs without modification

The choice depends on whether you're building new APIs or integrating with existing systems.

## Best Practices

### Integration Patterns

#### Product Catalog Integration Example

```javascript
{
  "name": "Product Catalog",
  "provider": "external-api",

# Start Trip - End Trip Feature

> The **Start - Finish** feature now has changed its name to **Start Trip - End Trip** Feature**.**

The **Start Trip - End Trip** feature enables MileApp Field users to log their coordinates at set intervals and defines a radius around the hub where they can start and end trips. This feature helps manage task access and location tracking, ensuring users are within designated boundaries.

To enable this feature, go to [**Settings➝Permission➝Advanced**](https://web.mile.app/setting/permission) on MileApp Web.

![](https://t3837933.p.clickup-attachments.com/t3837933/ad46a9c1-2213-428d-8b42-40720e4c44b7/image.png)

By default, the **Start Trip - End Trip** feature is deactivated. To use it, activate the toggle.

### If "Start Trip - End Trip" permission is on
When the Start Trip - End Trip permission is enabled, the **user’s location on the MileApp Field is tracked only if the Start Trip - End Trip feature is active**. The coordinate history will be available on the [Tracking Page.](https://web.mile.app/tasks/tracking)

This feature also ensures that MileApp Field users start their trip within a specified radius around the hub to access their tasks, and their location is tracked once they start the trip. The same applies to finish the trip, where users are restricted to finish the trip only within the designated radius around the hub.

If **Start Trip - End Trip** is active, there are three tracking modes available, each with different intervals and distances between recorded points:
1. **Power Saving** (Saves battery life): Updates location every 10 minutes, with a minimum distance of 10 meters between points.
2. **Balance** (Optimizes accuracy and battery usage): Updates location every 3 minutes, with a minimum distance of 20 meters between points.
3. **High Accuracy** (Consumes battery quickly): Updates location every 1 minute, with a minimum distance of 10 meters between points.

![](https://t3837933.p.clickup-attachments.com/t3837933/780c78ba-88c6-41df-b7f2-d6d896d90f65/image.png)

### If "Start Trip - End Trip" permission is off
When the Start Trip - End Trip permission is **disabled**, only task coordinates are recorded, and the user’s location on the MileApp Field **is not tracked**. Users can access tasks on the MileApp Field without starting a trip.

## Configuring the Feature
You could find the Start Finish feature at the [Permission Page](https://web.mile.app/setting/permission) of the MileApp web, the location is under the "Advanced" setting on the Permission.

This is where you set up the "Start Trip - End Trip" feature:
1. **Toggle** to enable or disable.
2. **Coordinate recording interval**: Set how frequently the app logs the user’s coordinates (e.g., every 5 minutes).
3. **Start Radius**: Defines the maximum distance from the hub to start the trip.
4. **Finish Radius**: Defines the maximum distance from the hub to end the trip and stop the coordinate recording.

![](https://t3837933.p.clickup-attachments.com/t3837933/07d250db-d8d5-4a06-b007-c0d9b1d9cffd/image.png)

### Usage Examples
*   **Setting Coordinate Recording Interval**: If set to 5 minutes, the app logs coordinates every 5 minutes during the trip.
*   **Setting Start and Finish Radius**:
    *   If the **Start Radius** is 500 meters, users can start tasks if they initiate the trip within 500 meters of the hub.
    *   Similarly, with a **Finish Radius** of 500 meters, users can end the trip only if within 500 meters of the hub.
*   If both radii are set to **0 meters**, users can start and end the trip from any location, allowing unrestricted access and tracking.

## Managing Hub Access
A critical aspect of user management is controlling and regulating access to different hubs within the system. A hub is a centralized location for organizing and accessing specific information, data, or resources. The Managing Hub Access feature in the Setting-User menu allows you to determine which hubs a user has permission to access.

The hub access granted to a user directly impacts the filter hub functionality located in the right corner of every page. This filter lets users narrow the displayed information based on a specific hub. However, if users cannot access a particular hub, they cannot filter by that hub.

![](https://t3837933.p.clickup-attachments.com/t3837933/671377f2-8dce-4ba6-942a-3ca229b2e17d/image.png)
_Hub selection for a specific user_

For example, let's say there are three hubs in the system: Hub A, Hub B, and Hub C. If User X has been granted access to Hub A and Hub B but not Hub C, they will only be able to filter information based on Hub A and Hub B. The filter hub feature will not display Hub C as an option for User X since they cannot access it.

![](https://t3837933.p.clickup-attachments.com/t3837933/611762e5-395f-46a6-838e-9707bed5e03e/image.png)
_The hub filter is located in the top right corner of the Task page._

By controlling hub access for each user, you can ensure they only see and interact with the hubs relevant to their role and responsibilities within the system. This helps maintain data integrity, security, and a streamlined user experience.

As an administrator or user with appropriate privileges, you can modify a user's hub access by editing their profile within the Setting-User menu. By granting or revoking hub access for specific users, you can effectively manage their ability to filter and access information related to different hubs.

## Roles Overview
Upon successful registration and organization verification, your organization will be equipped with four distinct roles.
1. **Owner**: The Owner role holds absolute authority within the system. Owners have unrestricted access to all permissions and functionalities. This role cannot be switched off and is typically reserved for system administrators or high-level decision-makers. Unlike other roles, the Owner role cannot be switched off, renamed, or deleted.
2. **Admin**: The Admin role is responsible for managing the administration of the system. Similar to the Owner role, Admins have comprehensive access to permissions and functionalities. In other organizations, the Admin role can be assigned as the Field User Manager, responsible for overseeing field users' activities and optimizing their workflows.
3. **Planner**: The Planner role is designed for users responsible for managing tasks and routes for field users.
4. **Field User**: The Field User role represents users who perform tasks and operations in the field. This role is typically assigned to individuals such as drivers, sales representatives, or service technicians who execute tasks outside the office. Field Users have specific access permissions relevant to their responsibilities.
### Role Restrictions and Permissions
**Owner Role:**
*   The "Owner" of the organization cannot be deleted or have their role changed, due to billing-related constraints.
**Exclusive Permissions for Owners:**
*   Only the "Owner" can:
    *   Invite another user as an "Owner".
    *   Change another user to "Owner".

# Integration



# SSO with Azure AD (Entra)

This documentation outlines the steps to integrate Single Sign-On (SSO) using Microsoft Azure Active Directory (AD) with MileApp. This integration allows users to authenticate using their Azure AD credentials.

Required Permission :
*   View integration
*   Create integration

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:
1. **Azure AD Subscription**: A valid Azure AD account with administrator privileges.
2. **MileApp Access**: Access to the MileApp administration settings.
3. **Application Registration**: An application registered in Azure AD for MileApp.
###   

### Step 1: Register MileApp in Azure AD
1. **Log into the Azure Portal**: Navigate to [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/).

![](https://t3837933.p.clickup-attachments.com/t3837933/181b0bec-d0c9-4178-8286-edda54c79f4e/image.png)

2. **Create a New Application**:
    *   Go to **Azure Active Directory** > **All aplication** > **New application**.
    ![](https://t3837933.p.clickup-attachments.com/t3837933/1dadffde-7218-4a90-8bc3-b117ecf4ac2c/image.png)

4. Enter a unique ID. Note: This ID will be used in the saml.config file for the service provider name. Therefore, note the ID. For e.g: you can enter the ID as [`https://your-mileapp-url.com`](https://your-mileapp-url.com/)
5. Next, click **Add reply URL**.
6. Enter the application **callback URL** where the response will be posted. For now, you can enter a dummy URL e.g. [`https://your-mileapp-url.com/auth/sso`](https://your-mileapp-url.com/auth/sso)
7. Select **Save**. Close the Basic SAML Configuration page.
8. Now scroll down to Set up MileApp app. Copy the Login URL . You will need this URL on MileApp.
9. **SAML Signing Certificate**:
    *   Download the **Certificate (Base64)** by clicking on the **Download** button. This certificate will be used in MileApp for SSO configuration.

### Step 3: Configure MileApp for SSO
1. **Log into MileApp**: Access the settings menu of MileApp.
2. **Navigate to SSO Settings**:
    *   Go to **Setting** > **Integration** > **Azure** **SSO Configuration**.
3. **Enter SSO Details:**
    1. paste the **Login URL** that you copied from Azure.

#### Steps:
1. Open the **Users and Groups** menu.
2. Click **Add User/Group** to register users who can access MileApp.
3. Only registered users in Azure can log in to MileApp using their Azure accounts.
###   

### **Login to MileApp via Microsoft Account with Azure SSO**
1. **Complete the Setup Process**

After successfully completing the setup steps for Azure SSO, you can proceed to log in to MileApp using your Microsoft account.

2. **Access the Office Portal**

![](https://t3837933.p.clickup-attachments.com/t3837933/8f449da5-08a4-447a-abe1-c5950bd5e986/image.png)

![](https://t3837933.p.clickup-attachments.com/t3837933/0a56c669-ac3d-4e25-a73d-fc2b3e15b42f/image.png)
1. Open the Microsoft Office web portal at [https://www.office.com/](https://www.office.com/).
2. Log in with your Microsoft account credentials.

3. **Navigate to MileApp**

![](https://t3837933.p.clickup-attachments.com/t3837933/5379f914-669c-4cf2-bb70-ae81af76f50c/image.png)
1. Once logged in, click on the **App Launcher** (the grid icon) on the left-hand side of the screen.
2. Select **MileApp** from the list of available applications to access the MileApp web platform.

By following these steps, you will be successfully logged into MileApp through your Microsoft account integrated with Azure SSO.
####   

#### Notes:
1. If you already have a MileApp account and want to integrate it with Azure SSO, ensure that the email registered in Azure AD matches the email used in your MileApp account.
2. If the email registered in Azure AD differs from the email registered in MileApp, it will be considered a separate account.
3. If a user has been invited through MileApp but has not completed the verification process via email and is then registered in Azure using the same email, they cannot log in to MileApp until the verification is complete. You can complete the verification process via email or delete the unverified user in the **User Settings** menu to allow access.
#### Tips:
1. Ensure you have **View** and **Create Integration** permissions to configure the integration.
2. You can still set a password in MileApp even after your account is registered in Azure. The password can be used for logging in through the MileApp login page.

# Tooltip Research

# [**Tooltips: How to Craft Effective Guiding Text**](https://www.wix.com/wordsmatter/blog/2020/06/tooltips/)
## Key takeaway:
*   Definition: a guiding message that appears when you hover over a graphic element online, such as an icon, image or link.
*   Usually indicated by a small question (?) mark, exclamation (!) mark or "i" icon.
*   Tooltips is secondary in nature, not a primary guiding text
*   **Critical info should always appear on the screen, not tucked away behind a tooltip icon that can easily be overlooked**
*   Used correctly, tooltips are a powerful secret weapon. They make your product feel slick, professional and easy to use. This might leads to user trust.

## Do's Don'ts:
### **Add value**
Tooltip should be helpful or interesting, and always relevant. If a component or feature is pretty obvious, don't use tooltip, it's unnecessary and could be annoying if overused.

### **Keep it short but link to more**

![](https://t3837933.p.clickup-attachments.com/t3837933/cf8ee38b-31a6-4c51-8f04-0f17e1294bd6/image.png)

In general, keep your tooltips to 1-2 sentences. If there's more you need to say, you can add a _'Learn more'_ link leading to a Help article.

Structure:

\- Display critical info on the page (title)

\- Add brief, extra guidance in the tip (on hover or click i icon)

\- Link to in-depth explanation (inside the tooltip)

### **Cut the fluff**

![](https://t3837933.p.clickup-attachments.com/t3837933/e69e9ef3-7513-426b-a980-2d151b61ff8e/image.png)

An effective tooltip gets right to the point and lets users continue on their way.

### **Include the Benefit**

![](https://t3837933.p.clickup-attachments.com/t3837933/2aec6fe3-efad-42f9-b8aa-273656f193cc/image.png)

If a feature has an important or interesting benefit, include it in your tooltip.

Apply the "What > So What > Now What" approach. This is where you first explain what the feature is (the What), then the benefit (the So What), and optionally a call to action (the Now What).

### **Use consistent formatting**

Some tooltips have titles. Some don’t.

With discoverability tooltips for example, you may have a title with the word “New,” and no title for your inline tips.

Make sure to keep your format, punctuation, and alignment consistent to look professional. Users notice.

### **Punctuate sentences**

You may be tempted to drop the period for a one-line tooltip.

However, a 2-3 sentence tooltip with no punctuation would obviously look strange. So to stay consistent and play it safe, punctuate.

### **Give examples**

![](https://t3837933.p.clickup-attachments.com/t3837933/92597d90-2225-48f4-b03d-7e30cef35e9b/image.png)

Nothing beats a good example to illustrate a point. Take advantage of the extra space provided by a tooltip to inspire users with real examples

### **Write in active voice**

![](https://t3837933.p.clickup-attachments.com/t3837933/8fdb4e61-e99e-457a-8972-5d84e0b92756/image.png)

Active voice is action-oriented language, starting with a verb. it is preferred for any UX text, and especially for tooltips since they need to be brief and empowering.

### **Create the trifecta**

![](https://t3837933.p.clickup-attachments.com/t3837933/ec4d07ea-d9e1-4099-9130-f86e7c357db9/image.png)

Tooltips don’t live in isolation. Always consider their surrounding environment. Forms for example, often contain labels, tooltips and placeholders.

Strategize the content of these three elements to craft _the copy trifecta_ and pack a powerful punch.

### **Incorporate your brand’s voice**

A spark of your brand’s personality can show, even in tooltips. That being said, you don’t want to “try too hard” or you’ll risk confusing or annoying your audience. Refer to your company’s [style guide](https://www.wix.com/blog/content-writing/2018/03/how-to-write-a-style-guide-for-business/) and values to make sure you’re hitting just the right [voice and tone](https://www.wix.com/blog/content-writing/2018/03/how-we-built-a-consistent-brand-voice-at-wix/).

At Wix, our voice is less about trying to be impressively cute or funny, and more about enabling users to succeed in using our product. We try to pack as much value and good advice as we can throughout the user journey. Here’s an example of our voice in action:

![](https://t3837933.p.clickup-attachments.com/t3837933/c185eccd-b094-4c46-9965-713ad7066f56/image.png)

## Type of tooltip:
### **Inline tooltip**
![](https://t3837933.p.clickup-attachments.com/t3837933/ef0601fe-fc40-4ab4-83bf-a282219ab210/image.png)
Provide highly contextual info of a certain part of the product. Can be found anywhere, next to links, icons, form labels, column headings, text fields, subheaders and more.

### **Label tooltip**
![](https://t3837933.p.clickup-attachments.com/t3837933/f59c94ea-4bec-4b93-8a7e-c3fa04eba5af/image.png)
Usually use to display the names of toolbar icons on hover, but also use to expand a cropped / collapsed information.

### **Discoverability tooltip**
![](https://t3837933.p.clickup-attachments.com/t3837933/05816243-bfe5-42b0-a4c3-55560fb45404/image.png)
Could be use to bring user attention to a new or overlooked feature in the product. Maybe we could use it when we release a new & big feature.

### **Tour tooltip**
![](https://t3837933.p.clickup-attachments.com/t3837933/ec7a6164-5837-4c84-a082-1375142595f6/image.png)
Similar with the discoverability tip, the tour tip introduce something new, but it's displayed in a series of steps. We have try it in our onboarding with the Userpilot.

### Triggered tips
![](https://t3837933.p.clickup-attachments.com/t3837933/b8ab7188-1f22-4059-86b6-14744e1bf267/image.png)
Tips that triggered according to user's profile or a condition. Maybe we could use this type of tip when user create their first task, success upgrading their license (celebratory kind).

* * *

## When to use tooltip
Really understanding _when_ to add them is half the battle, and this comes from the skill of anticipating user pain points.

### **Consider your users’ background**
Plan a strategy for how often to use inline tooltips and for what purpose. If your users are extremely tech savvy or professionals in their field, you may not need to further explain every label or action.
If your users are novice or varied, you may want to add more tooltips and explain more basic functions.

### **Put yourself in users’ shoes**
So how do we put ourselves in users’ shoes? The answer—it’s a mind shift. When you look at design screens, imagine it’s the very first time you’re seeing the product. Then go through the flow.
Where do you linger or get stuck? Ask yourself, _what terms could be clearer?_ And most importantly, _how do you feel?_

Anywhere that you pause, wonder, hesitate, feel anxiety or frustration—add a tip. Because you can be sure that a good percentage of your users will feel the same way. - _internal test? intro?_

### **Talk to support**
Once a feature is in production, it’s crucial that you talk to your support team to discover where users actually get stuck. It’s a fast and efficient practice for getting inside information right from the source - your users. - _interview_

### **Set up a usability session**
Watch people use your product. Ask them to talk out loud so you can hear their thought processes. Listen for areas where they ask questions, or where they pause trying to figure something out. That’s where you add a tip. - _hotjar_

### **Don’t explain navigation**
A tooltip should focus on a feature’s functionality or benefit. If you find yourself trying to explain navigation or product, there’s likely a bigger issue going on. It may be time to talk to your team and head back to the drawing board.

# v.20 Release

08 May 2023
# **Check In & Check Out**
The Check in Check out feature allows you to set recording intervals for MileApp Field user coordinates and establish a radius around your hub for them to start accessing their tasks. Important

**Notes:** With the release of the Check in Check out feature, user coordinate on the MileApp Field will be only tracked if the Check in Check out feature is active.

By default setting for this feature will be off. _Consideration: Because this is an advance feature, if we turned this on by default might be confusing for new user._

# **Separate Capacity Constraint**
We are excited to announce the release of a new feature that will help you better manage capacity constraints across your organization! This feature allows for individual hub configurations, while still taking into account the overall capacity constraints of the organization. With this feature, it's never been easier to ensure that each hub has the perfect configuration for its purpose. So go ahead and try it out.
![](https://t3837933.p.clickup-attachments.com/t3837933/1bc39af9-ab49-40bf-a329-211efe29b131/image.png)

# Enable routing optimization without setting the parameters in menu flow > routing > configuration
We're excited to announce an improvement that allows you to use routing optimization even if routing configuration has not been set yet. With this feature, you can still take advantage of route optimization without having to set up routing configuration first. However, the data will not be saved in the data task when dispatching and will disappear when the page is refreshed. This is a great way to get started with routing optimization, so go ahead and give it a try!

# v.23 Release

12 May 2023

_Enhancement in the display of More Information_

In this enhancement, we divide the information into six segregated :
1. **Field** : Represents the information contained in the page(n) component.
2. **Time** : Information on the user's activity time during the process of creating a task until the time the task is completed.
3. **User** : This contains details about the actors who perform tasks from the time they are created until they are finished.
4. **Media** : Contains image information, both photos and signatures.
5. **Route** : If you use the route optimization feature in our application, you can now access the information here. However, if you do not use it, this tab will not be displayed.
6. **Other** : You may find any further information you might need right here.

# v.28 Release

23 May 2023
# **Password Strength Improvement**
To improve the security of MileApp account, we have updated the requirement for a password, the new password standard is stated below:
_The password field must be at least 8 characters and contains a mix of lowercase, uppercase, numbers & symbols._

Example of improved password format to boost its strength: `!123aBc456`

# v.29 Release

24 May 2023
# Use the route optimization without configuring routing at the menu Flow
Change validation on flow - configuration - routing

1. You can now leave the address and coordinates fields on the configuration routing empty and still geocode from the Visit menu. If no visit name is provided in the configuration, the field will take from the task title. If the task title isn't set, it will appear as "(not set)" with information on how to configure it in the detail visit. If you want to change the visit name, you can either go to the configuration page or edit it directly from the detail visit page.

# Improvement Feature Capacity Constraint

We've improved the functionality of the configuration capacity constraint so that the reserved key cannot be used as a capacity constraint. This means that the key will be exclusively used for its intended purpose - to store field information in the Visit and Vehicle menus. We believe this will make your user experience more efficient, as it eliminates any potential confusion between the two functions. Thanks for your patience while we worked on this improvement!

![](https://t3837933.p.clickup-attachments.com/t3837933/24a71258-b196-43fc-aa6b-149bb0bbe1aa/image.png)

# Group active & inactive users on Task Tracking
Users that have Task & location history will be put in the **Active** group, while users that didn't have Task & location history will be put in the **Inactive** group. This will make it easier to differentiate users that currently have active tasks in a day.

To see all active users on that day, you could click the **Active** title.

_Menu Tracking_

# Handle Ongoing Task that is assigned to multiple users on Task Tracking
If a Task is assigned to multiple users, and the status is "Ongoing", this would be shown on the Tracking page on the multiple users that are assigned to that task.

# Track usage of users that only use Visit or Routing API
Users that only use API could also be tracked, and the data could be shown on the invoice.

# Improvement - Feature Auto Set Location In Menu Visit
With this update, we have implemented an alert to ensure you input your address before using the "Auto Set Location" feature. When you click the "Auto Set Location" button in the Visit menu without providing the address, the system will display a helpful alert message, "Please input your address first." This alert will remind you to enter the address to enable the geocoding process.

![](https://t3837933.p.clickup-attachments.com/t3837933/e0d42675-35c4-498f-aca6-524b75e56ff0/image.png)
_Hover over map icon to see the Auto Set Location button on the visit list_

How it Works:

1. Open the Visit menu on the web.
2. Upon clicking the Auto Set Location button without providing an address, an alert will be triggered, displaying the message "Please input your address first."

![](https://t3837933.p.clickup-attachments.com/t3837933/1a4c374e-1331-4196-b561-2909a23f0097/image.png)

3. You can acknowledge the alert message and then proceed to enter your address.
4. Once the address is provided and clicked the "Auto Set Location" button, the system will then initiate a geocoding process to determine the precise coordinates associated with the provided address.

After the coordinate is set, you can proceed to use our optimization route feature to plan your visit efficiently and effectively.

# Improvement - Adding Dropdown Selection for Assignee in Create Task Form
We have added a dropdown selection for the "Assignee" field within the "Create Task" form. When creating a new task, you can now easily assign it to the appropriate team member by selecting their name from a dropdown list within the "Assignee" field. This dropdown will dynamically populate with the list of available team members, ensuring accuracy and ease of use.

![](https://t3837933.p.clickup-attachments.com/t3837933/67ce044d-646f-4e40-9f96-d445fa8914a0/image.png)

# v.33 Release

31 May 2023
# Improvement in Vehicle List
We are excited to announce the new improvement to our menu vehicle! Now, users can easily get a better overview of the total tasks assigned and the total capacity for each vehicle that has been route optimized. This will help you to ensure you're not overloading your vehicles, and make sure you're getting the most out of each journey. This allows you to make informed decisions when choosing which vehicle to assign for the next optimization, considering its remaining capacity from the previous optimization.

![](https://t3837933.p.clickup-attachments.com/t3837933/411e841c-e9a9-41eb-9882-f2786da172a0/image.png)
_Hover over the package icon to see the summary of assigned tasks and capacity_

Please note:
1. If **the summary is not shown immediately**, don't worry! To retrieve the data, simply open the menu Visit first and then navigate back to the menu Vehicle. This ensures that the most up-to-date information is available for you to view.
2. If the total capacity information is still not visible, it's essential to **configure the constraints in the menu Flow/Configuration/Routing**. Ensure that the necessary constraints are properly set up, as this will enable the system to accurately calculate and display the total capacity for each vehicle.
3. If the summary capacity is still **not showing or is still 0%**, please try clearing the cache or re-login. But if your vehicle does not have the maximum capacity, then the summary capacity will remain 0%.
4. The summary will only count the **ongoing** task and will calculate after you click the **dispatch** button on the menu Result.

# Improved Colors for Result Optimization Route: Enhancing Visibility for Clearer Map Results
We've made some significant improvements to the color scheme of our result optimization route feature. We wanted to make sure that our users have the best possible experience while viewing the results on the map.

In this release, we've decided to remove the light colors from the route visualization. We realized that light colors were making it difficult for users to see the results clearly on the map. We understand how frustrating that can be, so we took your feedback seriously and made this change to enhance visibility.

Please note that we have provided 100+ colors for route optimization and have possibility to duplicate the color.

![](https://t3837933.p.clickup-attachments.com/t3837933/f84b12a5-fee8-4b72-8d67-0ab06e04a6c7/image.png)

# Expected Coordinate Generated from Flow
## Definition
Expected Coordinate is based on the Input Coordinate that you put in your Initial Page.
These expected coordinates will be used on the mobile app to generate the Task on the Ongoing list on Google Maps.

*   The first method to set an Input Coordinate component from your Initial Page as Expected Coordinate you need to set the Input Coordinate on the Flow ➝ Configuration ➝ Routing ➝ Coordinate as shown below:
![](https://t3837933.p.clickup-attachments.com/t3837933/f11afe14-a535-45f8-9879-f4c99a779071/image.png)

*   The second method is, we will set the Expected Coordinate automatically for you based on the first Input Coordinate component that we found on the initial page from the Flow. This will happen if you didn't set the Flow Routing Configuration on the previous point, below is the example:
![](https://t3837933.p.clickup-attachments.com/t3837933/f6343e31-1329-4708-a8b3-a3e59d0ead42/image.png)
_The expected coordinate will be taken from the component that is highlighted above, this component is chosen as the expected coordinate because it was the 1st Input Coordinate type of component._

Important Notes: For existing Flow you need to re-save the Flow so the expected coordinate will be set on that Flow, you could set it from Flow Configuration Routing, or let us set the first Input Coordinate on your Initial Page as the Expected Coordinate.

## Usage
This is how the expected coordinate will be shown on mobile.
Expected Coordinate will be shown on the Mobile App when you clicked the top right icon (map marker icon) on the Ongoing tab:
![](https://t3837933.p.clickup-attachments.com/t3837933/62ab5293-e0e1-4841-8d50-949acf6bccdf/image.png)

After you click the icon, the Task that is on the ongoing list and have the Expected Coordinate key, will be generated on the Google Map:
![](https://t3837933.p.clickup-attachments.com/t3837933/ba49fee9-7088-419e-a458-d8de692c463a/image.png)

Please note that the "Do Task" icon will disappear under the following conditions:

\- The task has not yet started. This occurs when the task's start time is ahead of the current time.
\- The task has expired. This occurs when the task's end time has already occurred.
\- The task is unassigned or not assigned to the same user login in the web application.
\- The task has been marked as "Done" indicating completion.

Key Features:

1\. Guidance to Routing-Visit: The message will suggest you navigate to the Routing-Visit menu to input relevant data about your visits, such as addresses, time constraints, and capacity constraint. This step is crucial for accurate route optimization.

2\. Guidance to Routing-Vehicle: Additionally, you will be directed to the Routing-Vehicle menu, where you can enter vehicle-related details like vehicle name, tags, working time, and specific constraints. This information ensures optimal resource allocation during route planning.

### Menu Routing-Result Improvement: Dispatching Routed Visits with Unassigned Vehicles

This enhancement addresses a limitation in the previous version where you were unable to dispatch the routing result if there were unassigned vehicles with routed visits. With the latest update, you can now dispatch the routing result even when there are unassigned vehicles with routed visits.

Key Improvement:

1\. Dispatching Routed Visits with Unassigned Vehicles: Previously, if there were unassigned vehicles with routed visits, you were unable to dispatch the routing result. However, with this update, you have the capability to dispatch the routing result despite the presence of unassigned vehicles.

![](https://t3837933.p.clickup-attachments.com/t3837933/1c458b71-4331-44df-9280-3a23758b2cc5/image.png)

Important Note:
It's crucial to understand that when you perform the next routing optimization, the unassigned routed visits will not remain assigned to the same vehicle. The system will reassign them based on the new optimization process. Therefore, it's necessary to review and assign the unassigned visits again during subsequent routing optimizations.

Change:

1\. The default result name in the Routing-Result menu has been modified for better clarity and simplicity.
2\. The year component of the result name will no longer be displayed.
3\. The word "Result" has been replaced with "Routing" to accurately reflect the purpose of the result.
4\. The new default result name will be "Routing 12-01 10:50".

### Menu Routing-Result - Exported Result File Name Update

Starting from this update, when you export a result from the Routing-Result menu, the file name will be more concise and follow the "{hub name}-{result name}" format. This change aims to improve the clarity and organization of exported result files.

Key Changes:

1. Simplified Exported Result File Names: Previously, the exported result file names included additional information that could be excessive and potentially cluttered. We have streamlined the naming convention to provide a more concise representation.
2. "{hub name}-{result name}" Format: The new file name format combines the name of the hub associated with the result and the specific result name. This format allows for easy identification and sorting of exported result files, facilitating better organization and management.

Example:
Suppose you export a result from the hub named "Jakarta" and the result name is "Result 2" In that case, the exported file will now be named "Jakarta-Result 2.xlsx".

![](https://t3837933.p.clickup-attachments.com/t3837933/ef1dbef3-b692-4fdf-a7c8-a5bead5e3e6e/image.png)

### Menu Routing/Visit Improvement - Tooltip Display for Trimmed Indonesian Labels

Previously, when a label in Indonesian was trimmed due to limited space in the user interface, the tooltip associated with the label did not appear. This posed a challenge for users who needed additional information to understand the purpose or functionality of the trimmed label. In this release, we have resolved this issue by ensuring that tooltips are displayed consistently, even when labels are trimmed in Indonesian.

### Remove name field in sign up

### ETA Calculation for the Ongoing Task on the Tracking Page

When you hover over the Ongoing Task icon you might see an additional tooltip, but this tooltip will only be displayed if:
*   The task has been optimized and dispatched from the [route optimization](https://web.mile.app/route/visit) menu.
*   The user location history is updated, or the [Start Finish feature](https://web.mile.app/setting/permission) is active for that user so the user location history and time are recorded properly.

If those two conditions are fulfilled, new information will be generated for this Ongoing task icon, and you could see this tooltip when you hover over the Ongoing Task icon:

![](https://t3837933.p.clickup-attachments.com/t3837933/da03beaa-cf89-4544-9547-2d5ea543a32f/image.png)
*   ETA (hour : minutes)

This ETA will show you the estimated arrival time of the user to this task location, the calculation is based on the Last Update location of the user and the time that they need to reach this task location from their latest location history.

*   Delay Estimate (+\[number\] mins)

This information will **only be displayed if the user is estimated to be late to reach their next task location compared to the ETA** that is generated from the route optimization process. But, if the estimate is within the ETA or earlier than the ETA, this extra information won't be displayed.

# v.3.30 Release

## Enhancement
### Improved Maps - Enhanced Support for Japan

With this release, users can now utilize the Routing module seamlessly within the Japanese region. We have added Japan to the list of supported countries in the "Form Verification Account" section. Now, when users create or edit accounts, they can select Japan as their country of operation, enabling them to leverage Routing services within the Japanese territory. This allows organizations operating in Japan to configure their Routing preferences according to their specific requirements.

![](https://t3837933.p.clickup-attachments.com/t3837933/350eda46-0aa4-412b-b0de-1f3e9407ea62/image.png)
_Example routing result in Japan_

Note: When users choose Japan as their country of operation during account verification, they will not be able to set the location of their hub outside the Japan area. Similarly, for other countries, the hub location must remain within the selected country's borders.

_Export the routing data from the "Routing/Result" menu_

We are excited to announce some significant improvements to the Export Routing Optimization Result feature in Excel. These updates aim to provide users with a more seamless and informative experience when analyzing their optimization results. Here's what's new in this release:

#### 1\. User-Friendly Header Names:
We understand the importance of clear and intuitive information presentation. With this update, we have enhanced the header names displayed in the Excel export. Instead of using raw database keys, the exported data now showcases more user-friendly and descriptive header names. This change ensures that users can easily comprehend the data without any confusion.

#### 2\. Improved Summary Sheet for Vehicle Data:
This sheet presents essential information related to each vehicle, including the Vehicle ID, Vehicle Name, Assignee, Vehicle Tags, Capacity Constraint, Speed (Km/h), Fixed Cost, Total Travel Time (mins), Total Distance (m), and more. By centralizing this information, users can efficiently evaluate the performance of each vehicle and make informed decisions for their optimization strategies.

#### 3\. Changing Header Name "Total Drop Points" to "Total Unique Visits":
In response to user feedback and to provide better clarity, we have updated the header name "Total Drop Points" to "Total Unique Visits." This change reflects the accurate representation of the data, which indicates the count of unique visit coordinates.

### Webhook "onRoutingFinished" Trigger Enhancement

Previously, the "onRoutingFinished" webhook was only triggered in cases where the routing process was successful. With this update, the webhook will be consistently triggered after every routing operation, irrespective of the final status, be it successful or unsuccessful.

![](https://t3837933.p.clickup-attachments.com/t3837933/7b7a4af3-afaf-47a7-9c4d-f9e103b79413/image.png)
_When the routing process is completed, the system will log the webhook._

### Menu Setting/User Improvements
We are excited to announce some significant improvements to the User section of the Menu Setting. With this update, we have focused on enhancing user editing and optimizing the invite user mechanism to provide a smoother and more efficient experience. Let's dive into the details:

#### 1\. Introducing Consistent User Editing:
In the past, users were able to edit a user's name directly from the table user list. However, we've taken a step forward and revamped the design to create a more cohesive and intuitive interface. With this update, you will now notice an edit icon displayed beside each user's name.
By simply clicking on the edit icon, you can now modify a user's name conveniently and efficiently. This change not only enhances usability but also ensures consistency in the way user information is edited across different sections of the application. We believe that this streamlined process will save you time and effort when managing user details.

#### 2\. Improved Invite User Mechanism:
We understand the importance of a smooth and error-free invitation process. To enhance the invite user mechanism, we've made a crucial adjustment - pressing the Enter key on the keyboard will no longer trigger form submission.
Instead, the cursor will remain in the input field, allowing you to effortlessly continue adding email addresses without unintentionally triggering actions. You now have complete control over when the invitations are sent out. To complete the process, simply click the "Invite" button when you are ready to send the invites.

### Menu Setting/Hub - Improved Address Field
We have expanded the Address field to conform to our current standard. Now, when users open the form to create or edit a hub, the Address field will automatically show three lines, providing ample space to input detailed location information.

## Bug Fix

### Task Export with Billing Component Issue Resolved
In this release, we have successfully addressed an issue with an export task that includes an invoice component. Previously, exporting such tasks could result in incomplete data and cause inconvenience to users.

_Form Create Hub_

**Key Highlight**:

1\. **Drag-and-Drop Coordinate Selection**: Once the coordinate is determined, the Address field will be automatically filled with the corresponding address information. Users can still make edits to the Address field if necessary

2\. **Seamless Coordinate Update**: During hub creation, if the Address field is already populated, users can still drag and drop the pin icon on the map to update the coordinate without affecting the previously entered address information.

3\. **Tooltip Guidance**: To enhance the user experience, we've added a helpful tooltip to the Address field. When users interact with the Address field, the tooltip text "Drag and drop the pin on the map" will appear, providing clear guidance on how to utilize the drag-and-drop feature.

*   **Symbols** (e.g., !, @, #, $, %, etc.)

Besides the requirements above, there's a mandatory **Minimum Length** for the Passwords, **it must be 8 characters or more**, to ensure that the password has adequate complexity.

### Introducing "resultCode" for Unique Result Optimization Data

We have introduced the optional key "resultCode" to our API response format.

Key Details:

Key Name: resultCode
Type: String
Format: Unique
Optional: Yes

**Automatic Response Generation**:
When making API requests without including the "resultCode" key, the system will automatically generate a unique resultCode in the API response. This simplifies the process for users who do not wish to specify a custom resultCode manually.

**Filtering Results**:
The "resultCode" key can now be used as a filtering parameter in API requests.

**How to Use resultCode**:
To include a custom resultCode in the API request, simply add the "resultCode" key to the payload and provide the desired unique value in the string format.

### Incorrect Capacity Constraint Percentage Display

We are pleased to announce a new bug fix that addresses an issue with the capacity constraint percentage display in the Routing/Result menu when users choose a vehicle.

Issue Description:
Previously, when users selected a vehicle in the Routing/Result menu, the capacity constraint percentage was incorrectly displayed as 0%, even though there was an actual value for the constraint (e.g., 7%). This inconsistency led to confusion and incorrect interpretations of vehicle capacities, potentially impacting route planning decisions.

Bug Fix:
With this release, we have resolved the capacity constraint percentage display issue. The correct percentage value will now be accurately reflected for the selected vehicle when displayed in the Routing/Result menu.

### Displaying Percentage Constraint NaN% in Menu Routing/Result

Impact:
This bug fix significantly improves the user experience by ensuring that users are promptly informed when they encounter access restrictions due to their role's permissions. It reduces confusion and frustration.

# v.3.37 Release

14 Aug 2023
## Enhancement
### Expanded Clustering Options for Enhanced Routing Optimization

We are excited to announce a significant enhancement to our routing and configuration menu with the addition of two distinct types of clustering options: "Normal Clustering" and "Balanced Clustering." These new options provide users with greater flexibility and control over how they group nearby visits, resulting in optimized routes that minimize both distance and travel time between locations.

New Clustering Options:

1\. **Normal Clustering**:
Choose this option if you want the system to decide how to group visits based on where they are. The system will look at which places are close to each other and put them in clusters. This helps make routes better by putting nearby places together.

2\. **Balanced Clustering**:
If you want things to be more fair and even, this option is for you. With balanced clustering, the system makes sure that visits are divided equally among clusters before deciding how to group them based on location. This is great when you want every vehicle to have a similar amount of work and still have optimized routes.

You can pick the one that works best for what you need, making your route planning even better.
Learn more at [Routing Documentation](https://doc.clickup.com/3837933/p/h/3n3zd-81962/aa00834626ae24f/3n3zd-167822).

### Dropdown Role Selection Standardization in Menu Setting/User

In this release, we've standardized the dropdown role selection across the Menu Settings/User page, bringing it in line with the familiar format used in other page. Now, when assigning roles to users, you can expect a consistent and familiar experience throughout the application.

### Introducing Searchable Hub Filter for Enhanced Navigation

Key Features:

1\. Search on the Go: Say goodbye to endless scrolling through your hub filter. With the new search functionality, accessible from the right corner, you can now search for specific hub with ease.

2\. Instant Results: As you start typing in the search field, the hub filter will dynamically update in real-time, displaying only the hubs that match your query.

### Enhanced Value Uniformity in Routing and Dashboard Modules

This release focuses on refining exported routing results and the User Activity widget on the Dashboard. Here's a breakdown of the improvements:
1. **Routing Module: Exported Result Enhancement**. Capacity values in exported routing results are now rounded to one decimal place. This change brings about a harmonized appearance across all values in the routing results, simplifying analysis and enabling quicker decision-making.
2. **Dashboard Module: User Activity Widget**. The percentage values in the User Activity widget are now displayed with consistent rounding to one decimal place.

### Enhanced Data Display on Task List from Component Page(n)

### Enhanced Validation for Bulk Task Creation with Invalid startTime and endTime Values
We have improved the validation process for bulk task creation when the values of startTime and endTime are not valid. With this enhancement, you will now receive clearer information about data containing invalid start time and end time values. We have also made adjustments to align with the time settings in the Flow/Configuration menu.

### Enhanced Task Detail Information for Unfound Task Flows
In this update, we have made adjustments to the display of task details that are already created but do not have an associated flow. This improvement ensures a more consistent and informative experience for users encountering tasks without corresponding flows.

### Menu Routing/Vehicle Enhancement - Improved User Experience for Vehicle Creation

Previously, when users were creating a new vehicle and entered information into the Vehicle Tag field, pressing the "Enter" key would automatically submit the form, potentially leading to unintended submissions. We understand that the Vehicle Tag field is often used to input multiple tags, and accidental submissions could disrupt the workflow.

With this improvement, we've made a significant change to this behavior:

Pressing Enter on the keyboard will no longer immediately submit the form when you're in the process of entering multiple tags in the Vehicle Tag field. Instead, you can now confidently use the "Enter" key to add new tags without worrying about unintentionally submitting the form.

### ETA Calculation for Task that is not Optimized on the Routing menu
If you hover above the Ongoing Task icon that is not optimized in the Routing menu, a tooltip will appear that will show you the estimated arrival time of this user. The ETA is calculated based on the user's last update location and the location of the next task in the queue.

![](https://t3837933.p.clickup-attachments.com/t3837933/5f8fd1d2-6baf-4d3d-b42d-0dfca7a367c6/image.png)
**ETA,** _Example from the picture above: ETA 07:20_
This ETA will show you the **estimated arrival time of the user to this task location,** the calculation is based on the Last Update location of the user and the travel time that they need to reach this task location from their latest location history.

This feature enhances task management by providing users with valuable ETA predictions for tasks that are not been optimized within the routing menu. This feature will enable better decision-making, more transparency for your customer, improved customer service, and resource optimization, ultimately contributing to more efficient and effective task execution.

This feature is also compatible to calculate mixed task; which is a combination of task that is not Optimized at Routing, and task that is Optimized through the Routing menu seamlessly.

For example, see the picture below:
![](https://t3837933.p.clickup-attachments.com/t3837933/721f1131-76df-43b9-9a89-350183218123/image.png)
**A.** This is the last updated location history of the Field user.
**B.** This is the "next task location"; we get the user's ETA to this location by calculating the time the user needs to reach the next task location from their last updated location.
**C.** To calculate the task ETA after the "next task location"; we will calculate the time that is needed to get to the next task from the previous task location. We will repeat this calculation indefinitely as needed. For example, if you have 50 Tasks, this process is repeated for each task.

### **Enhanced Data Source Usage for List and Bill Components**
In this update, we've enhanced the functionality of list and bill components. Now, you can utilize data sources within list and bill components, simplifying the process of populating list items according to your data sources.

You have the option to activate a toggle on the list or bill components located in the "Pages" tab. From there, you can map the data source to be used as list items under the "Configuration/Data Source" tab, or directly map it within the "Flow/Configuration" menu.

_Mapping data source directly on Configuration tab_

**Note**: When mapping a list or bill components with a data source, all data sources will appear in the list items.

Additionally, we've made adjustments to the previous flow. Instead of selecting a data type first, you now need to choose the component before selecting the data type. If you select an input component, you'll map the data source to each individual component. If you choose a list or bill component, you'll map the data source using the reserved key from the respective list or bill component.

2. **Clustering**: Another instance is with clustering. Now, the "Clustering" configuration will be tabulated with its associated options: "Normal" and "Balanced."

### Enhanced Validation for Visit and Vehicle Tags, Alongside Capacity Constraints Check

In this release, we are launching two validation features: enhanced tag validation for visits and vehicles, and capacity constraints validation during vehicle creation and route optimization.

Key Features:
1\. Maximum Tag Limit: To ensure streamlined data, a maximum of 10 tags per visit and vehicle is now enforced. Requests exceeding this limit will be rejected, accompanied by an error response indicating the breach.

2\. Invalid Maximum Capacity Error: When adding a vehicle, attempting to set the maximum capacity value to be less than or equal to the minimum capacity will trigger an error message. This message will emphasize that the maximum capacity must exceed the minimum capacity value.

3\. Negative Capacity Values Handling: Error messages will promptly appear if negative capacity values are entered for minimum or maximum capacities. Users will be guided to input valid, non-negative, positive numerical values for both capacity fields.

Learn more at our [API documentation](https://apidoc.mile.app/#tag/Routing/operation/routing).

### Introducing the distanceFromHub Key in API POST Routing

###   

### Adjustment User Role Management for Non-"Owner" Roles

We have implemented role-based restrictions for users who do not possess the "Owner" role. This enhancement ensures that users with certain roles can only interact with users of specific roles, promoting a more controlled and secure environment.

*   **Invite Restrictions**: Users with roles other than "Owner" will now only be able to invite users with roles other than "Owner." This prevents inadvertent elevation of privileges and helps maintain a clear division of responsibilities within the platform.
*   **Deletion Restrictions**: Similarly, users without the "Owner" role will no longer have the ability to delete user accounts with the "Owner" role. This precautionary measure safeguards against unauthorized changes to crucial roles within the system.

### Trash (Deleted Data List)
We're excited to introduce a new feature that allows you to easily track deleted data. Now, when you delete data within our platform, it will be conveniently displayed in the Deleted Data List. This list allows you to review any deleted information within 30 days. After this period, the data will be permanently removed from our system.

### Enhanced Data Type List Table View

### Improved Alert Message with Order Number in Menu Routing/Visit

In scenarios where visit names might be duplicated, we have improved our alert messages to now include the associated Order Number along with the Visit Name.

When a time window conflict is detected, the alert message has been enhanced to provide better context. The message now includes both the Visit Name and the corresponding Order Number. This improvement ensures that users can quickly and accurately identify the specific visit affected, even when visit names are similar.

The new alert message format will be as follows:

"The time window for \[Visit Name\] (Order #\[Order Number\]) conflicts. The open time must be before the close time."

### Improved Map Display for Routing/Visit and Routing/Result

This update brings several improvements to handle large data more efficiently, provide better visualization, and offer optimized performance.

![](https://t3837933.p.clickup-attachments.com/t3837933/297ab805-db2d-4517-a60c-f1f2753dc43f/image.png)

Key Features:

1\. **Map Visit Grouping**: With this update, the map display intelligently groups nearby visits when dealing with a substantial number of visits. This prevents overlapping and clutter, providing a clearer view of your routes. Clustered visits are accompanied by a visual indicator showcasing the count of visits within each cluster. This at-a-glance understanding helps you quickly gauge the number of visits represented.

2\. **Zoom-In Visibility**: As you zoom in on the map, the grouped visits disperse into individual visit points. This feature ensures that you can focus on specific visits as you zoom in, enabling you to explore locations in greater detail.

3\. **Hub Coordinates Not Grouped**: Hub coordinates, crucial central points for your operations, remain ungrouped on the map. This decision ensures that you can effortlessly identify and distinguish the positions of your hubs without any clustering.

4\. **Clickable Cluster Markers**: Interactivity is key. Clicking on a clustered marker triggers the system to zoom in and display individual visit points within the cluster.

5\. **Optimized Performance**: We understand the importance of smooth navigation. Our system is optimized to handle large datasets without compromising performance. You'll experience seamless interaction with the map.

We believe that this enhancement will provide a better and more tailored experience in managing data access within our application.

### Improved Title Handling for Downloaded Templates
In the previous version, if you had components with the same title and downloaded a template, only one instance of the title flow would appear in the header file. In this enhancement, we have improved the system so that when you download a template flow, the header that appears now dynamically adjusts to the title, even if they share the same name.

### Export Task Improvement
In this update, we have introduced a limit when exporting tasks. Previously, attempting to export more than 1000 tasks would trigger an error notification. We have now addressed this issue. If you export more than 1000 tasks, the exported data will be limited to the first 1000 tasks based on the task start time order.

### Enhanced Flow Menu Title Display
We've made improvements to the way titles are displayed in the flow menu. If you have a very long title, we will now truncate it. To view the complete title, simply hover over it, and a popup will display the full title. We believe this enhancement will provide a more user-friendly experience.

"\[email\] is already used in other organization, please use another email."

Benefits:

1\. Clarity: The new alert message provides a clear and concise explanation of the issue, helping users understand why the invitation cannot proceed with the provided email address.

2\. Actionable Information: Users are informed about the need to use a different email address for the invitation, making it easier for them to take immediate corrective action.

### Removal of Tooltip for Capacity Constraint Decimal Values

In previous versions, users encountered a tooltip stating "Please enter a valid value" when attempting to input decimal values as capacity constraints. This misleading tooltip has been removed to eliminate any confusion or perception that decimal values are invalid. Users can confidently enter decimal values without any hindrance.

### Improved Assignee Standardization using User Names

We have implemented a standardization option for assignees, where user names will now be used instead of email addresses. This change will be reflected in the following areas:

1\. Vehicle - New Form Creation
2\. Vehicle - Form Editing
3\. Result - Assignee Dropdown

In this update, when a user clicks the cross (X) button for hubs in the menu setting/user interface, it will no longer submit the action immediately. Instead, it will initiate a selection mode that allows you to choose multiple hubs for removal. This delay in submission ensures that you have the flexibility to select and remove multiple items with ease, reducing the risk of accidental removals.

### Enhanced Task Menu Information and Start Time Date Format

In this update, we have improved the information within the task menu to make it easier for you to understand how to create tasks, especially when you don't have permission to view workflows (flows). Previously, no information appeared if you didn't have a workflow, which could be confusing. Now, we have added clear information to provide a better understanding of why the workflow list is not available.
Additionally, we have adjusted the date format for "Start Time" in the task list to make it more easily understandable and consistent. We hope these enhancements improve your user experience. Thank you for your support of our application.

## Enhancement

### Enhanced Security - Non-Owners Restricted from Updating Hub and Team for Users with Owner Role
With this update, non-owners will no longer be able to update the Hub and Team details of users with the Owner role. This ensures that Owner role privileges remain intact and prevents unauthorized changes.

### Dashboard Menu Improvement
In response to user feedback, we have revamped the Dashboard menu to make it more compact while ensuring you can access relevant information effortlessly.

**Key Features**:
1. **Compact Design**: We understand the importance of having immediate access to essential information without the need to scroll endlessly. With the new compact design, you can now view more widgets and data at a glance. The previous version of the Dashboard displayed only two widgets by default, which could be limiting.
2. **Enhanced Tooltip Text**: We've also taken your feedback on board regarding the tooltip text for dummy data on the Dashboard. We have revamped and refined the tooltip descriptions to provide you with clearer and more informative context about the data you are viewing.
3. **User Assignee Display**: User assignees are now represented by their names, enhancing privacy and making it easier to identify individuals involved in tasks.

### Menu Setting Permission Improvement
The Owner role is now positioned at the top of the list, ensuring that those with the highest level of authority are easily identifiable and accessible.

### Improved Handling of Bulk Task Creation
We have improved the handling of bulk task creation when using file imports. Previously, if there were spaces within columns without headers in the file, you would be prompted to download a new template. In this latest update, we have implemented a character space trim function for values outside of columns that do not have any values. This improvement ensures a smoother experience when importing files for bulk task creation.

### Image Upload via Link Supported in Bulk Task Creation
In this release, we have added support for uploading images via links during the creation of bulk tasks. Previously, if a flow contained a photo component and you attempted to create bulk tasks, that component was not supported. In this update, we have improved this functionality, allowing you to create bulk tasks that include photo components using links. This enhancement provides greater flexibility in managing your tasks.

# v.3.60 Release

09 Oct
## Enhancement

### Export Adjustments Based on Usage Flow
We have improved the data export feature to include only the flows you have used as tasks. If you have a flow that you haven't utilized in any tasks, its header will not appear in the exported file. This improvement ensures that your export files are more focused and contain only the relevant flow information that you have actively utilized in your tasks.

# v.3.61 Release

10 Oct
## Enhancement
### Menu Routing/Result Improvement

In this update, we have made an enhancement to the menu Routing/Result by reorganizing the layout for a more streamlined user experience. Specifically, we have relocated the result date, which was previously displayed next to the result name, to the 'Other' section in the Summary.

![](https://t3837933.p.clickup-attachments.com/t3837933/c5d9ec7c-dab3-4296-878a-389e8c3a1309/image.png)

# v.3.62 Release

11 Oct
## Enhancement
### Menu Routing/Result Improvement - Show Trip Number for Moved Visits

Previously, when you moved a visit from the dropped visits section to a vehicle using the config multitrip option, there was no information about which trip the visit belonged to. Now, with trip numbers displayed for each visit within a vehicle, it's now much easier to understand the order and organization of your routes.

Note: The moved visit will automatically be placed in the last trip of that vehicle's route. This ensures that your routes remain organized and easy to follow.

### Gantt Chart View Enhancement in Menu Routing/Result

Now, when you enable the multitrip option while optimizing your routes, the Gantt Chart View will automatically populate with comprehensive details for each visit associated with Trip N.

### Hide Configuration Clustering - Balanced Type in Menu Routing/Configuration

In this release, we have adjustment by hiding the "Balanced" clustering type configuration. This change will affect the UI menu under "Routing/Configuration." We have removed the option to select the "Balanced" clustering type, as it will now be automatically determined using standard clustering algorithms. This clustering type has been temporarily removed as we work on further improvements to the clustering functionality.

# v.3.62.1 Release

12 Oct
## Bug Fix

### Fixed task details issue
In this update, we've successfully addressed an issue related to viewing task details. Previously, the "More Details" section was not displaying data correctly. We're delighted to inform you that we have fixed this problem, allowing you to now seamlessly view data in the "More Details" section as intended. We appreciate your patience while we worked on this improvement, and we hope it enhances your app experience!

# v.3.63 Release

16 Oct
## Enhancement
### Menu Routing/Result Detail Visit Improvement

Previously, Menu Routing/Result provided a comprehensive overview of the routes and results for your specified locations, but it lacked essential address information. With this update, we have now added the address details for each visit in your routing/results list. This enhancement will help you quickly identify and navigate to each location with ease.

### Menu Routing/Result - Gantt Chart View Improvement

In the previous version, the Gantt Chart view did not include dropped visits. With this update, all dropped visits will now be displayed in the Gantt Chart view, offering a more complete overview of your routing results.

While we've made it possible to see dropped visits in the Gantt Chart, it's important to note that these visits will appear in List Mode. The reason for this is that dropped visits do not have ETA (Estimated Time of Arrival) and ETD (Estimated Time of Departure) values, which are essential for defining the width of the visit bars in the Gantt Chart.

### Automation Menu Enhancement
In this update, we have enhanced the automation menu. When you use the automation event 'On Task Finish' and the automation type is 'Create and Assign Task,' there is a toggle. When activated, you can select the task to be created and directly assign it using 'Done by,' 'Assign by,' and 'Assignee.'
![](https://t3837933.p.clickup-attachments.com/t3837933/30a3a3ad-fde6-442f-957e-5eb01b1ca8e2/image.png)
For example, if your automation settings are as follows:

**Event**: On Task Finish
**Automation Type**: Create and Assign Task
Trigger Automation Flow: Pickup
Subsequent Task Creation Flow: Delivery

Let's consider a Pickup flow task created by User A, assigned to User B and User C, and then completed by User B.

If Auto Assignment is activated and the Dropdown Assignee is 'Done by,' then:
*   The automation will create a delivery task assigned directly to User B.

If Auto Assignment is activated and the Dropdown Assignee is 'Assign by,' then:
*   The automation will create a delivery task assigned directly to User A.

If Auto Assignment is activated and the Dropdown Assignee is 'Assign by,' then:
*   The automation will create a delivery task assigned directly to User B and User C.

### Bulk Task Creation Enhancement
We have addressed an issue related to creating bulk tasks when using flows that contain list or bill components on the initial page. Previously, if there were spaces outside of columns or headers in the uploaded file used for bulk task creation, or if there were spaces at the beginning or end of sentences within columns or headers, issues would occur during the file import process.
We have now resolved this problem, ensuring that you can smoothly import files without any hitches.

# v.3.64 Release

17 Oct
## Enhancement
### Enhanced Ability to Create Bulk Tasks with Component Input Type Number
We are delighted to announce an enhancement to the MileApp's create bulk task feature. You can now easily create bulk tasks using flows that include number input components with an active unit toggle through the import file feature. Previously, you could only create tasks manually or use the single create bulk task option.

With this enhancement, you can efficiently create a large number of tasks by downloading a new template that includes the unit header. Then, simply fill in the unit header according to the desired unit for your number input components. This streamlines the process of creating a large number of tasks, making it more efficient and effective. Enjoy using this new feature!
###   

### Responsive Task Menu for an Enhanced User Experience
In this latest update, we are excited to introduce a responsive design for the task menu. With this responsive layout, we aim to provide you with a better and more user-friendly experience.

For menus that are not yet responsive, we have temporarily restricted access if you access them on screens with a width below 768px. Rest assured, we are actively working to make these menus responsive as well, so you can enjoy a seamless experience regardless of your screen size. Thank you for your understanding as we continue to enhance your user experience.

### Handling for Resource Loading Errors in Menu Visits

Previously, when a resource failed to load, users would encounter a generic "Error..." message, which could be frustrating and confusing. With this update, we aim to provide a more user-friendly experience by offering clear error messages and guidance for users encountering such issues. The new message reads, "Sorry, it looks like there is some problem here. Please refresh this page and try again." This improved message is designed to give users a better understanding of the issue they are facing.

### Dispatch Result Permission Added in Route Module

With this update, users can now restrict access to the "Dispatch" button based on specific user roles, ensuring more security and control in your routing workflows.

![](https://t3837933.p.clickup-attachments.com/t3837933/c92bc98e-99a0-4287-a2bf-d4582a06fab9/image.png)
_Permission "Dispatch result" in Setting/Permission Menu_

**Key Highlights**:

1\. **New Permission for Dispatch Result**: We have introduced a dedicated permission for "Dispatch Result" within the Route Module. Users with appropriate access can now control who is authorized to dispatch results for routing tasks.

2\. **Automatic Permission Inheritance**: To make the transition smoother for existing users, we've automatically granted the "Dispatch Result" permission to roles that previously had "View Routing Result" access. This means that after deploying this update, you won't need to manually enable the permission for each role.

3\. **Enhanced Security**: By adding this level of control to Dispatch Result permissions, you can ensure that only the right personnel have the authority to dispatch routing results. This feature is particularly valuable for maintaining data integrity and routing accuracy.

### Revised Placement of Capacity Constraints

*   In the previous version, capacity constraints that started with a **number** were displayed at the top of the form. We have redesigned the user interface to enhance usability.
*   Capacity constraints will now be positioned at the bottom of the form, following the presentation of other essential information regarding visits and vehicles.

# v.3.65 Release

18 Oct
## Enhancement
### Data Source Permission Notice
Now, when you attempt to use a data source to create a task without the necessary permission, a specific notification will appear. Previously, users would only see a loading screen without a clear notification. We have enhanced this experience to provide better information to users.

### Enhanced Select Component Validation
We've enhanced the select component by now displaying an asterisk (\*) when it's mandatory to be filled out. Previously, the asterisk on the select component appeared, but it didn't always align with the set requirements. This change ensures better clarity during task creation.

### Enhanced Photo Category Data Export
If you have a photo component in your flow and use photo categories, we've now enhanced the exported file to include photo category data. Previously, when you had a photo component with categories, the exported file didn't display photo category data. This update ensures that the photo category information is included in your export files, making your data more comprehensive.

### Change "Fixed Cost" to "Cost Factor" in Routing Vehicle and Routing Result Menus
We understand that clear and accurate terminology is crucial for an intuitive user experience. By changing "Fixed Cost" to "Cost Factor," we aim to provide users with a more precise and fitting description of the feature. You will notice the updated term "Cost Factor" instead of "Fixed Cost" when accessing the Routing Vehicle and Routing Result menus. This change is designed to make the functionality more user-friendly. It does not alter the main functionality of the feature, only the terminology used to describe it.

![](https://t3837933.p.clickup-attachments.com/t3837933/1365fd2d-977c-4274-9831-1a2e69f60d9b/image.png)

20 Oct
## Bug Fix
### Update User Name in Settings/User Menu

In this release, we have addressed a critical issue reported by our sales team in the Settings/User menu. The problem was related to user profile updates not being reflected consistently across all associated hubs when a user with multiple hubs changed their name. We have successfully fixed this bug to ensure that user name updates are now consistently applied to all hubs, regardless of any active filters.

# v.3.66.2 Release

23 Oct
## Bug Fix

### Direct Access to Tasks on Mobile
Previously, users with mobile devices opening the task menu and attempting to work on tasks by clicking the "Do Task" button faced an issue where the task page, where they should start working on the task (page n), wasn't displayed as expected. However, in this update, we have addressed this issue. You can now click the "Do Task" button and start working on the task directly without any issues.

Thank you for your understanding and support. We hope you have a smoother experience when using our application!

# v.3.67.0 Release

24 Oct
## Enhancement

### Automated Data Access Restriction
In this update, we have improved your ability to efficiently manage data access when utilizing automation for creating or updating data sources. This feature can now be found in the "Automation Event: On Task Finish" menu, under the automation type "Create or Update Data Source." If you have activated the "Limit Data By User" setting for the data type you have chosen, you can now easily toggle the "Auto Limit Data Access" option.
![](https://t3837933.p.clickup-attachments.com/t3837933/a483dc93-7a27-466c-b787-41b1d4e8a00f/image.png)

This allows you to automatically create data sources and define access rights based on criteria such as the user who created the task, the user who assigned the task, or the user who completed the task.

### Search Feature in Gantt Chart View for Dropped Visits

We are excited to introduce a new feature in the Gantt Chart view of the Routing/Result menu. With this release, users can now efficiently search for dropped visits in the Gantt Chart view, making it even easier to manage and analyze unoptimized routes.

Previously, in the Gantt Chart view, users could see the list of visits that were not part of the optimized route. However, users did not have the ability to search for specific dropped visits, making it challenging to identify and address specific issues.

### Vehicle Information in Map Detail Routing/Result Menu

Now, when you click on a visit marker on the map, you will see a pop-up detail that includes additional vehicle information. This improvement allows you to quickly identify the vehicle associated with a specific visit, making your route planning and management more convenient than ever before.

# v.3.68 Release

25 Oct
## Enhancement
### Unverified Users No Longer Visible in Assignment Dropdowns
*   Unverified users, for security reasons, will now be entirely invisible within the dropdown options for task and vehicle assignment.
*   This strategic change ensures that only verified user accounts can be selected for tasks and vehicle assignments.

# v.3.69 Release

30 Oct
## Enhancement
### Persistent Filter for Dropped Visits in Gantt Chart View Menu Routing/Result

With this update, any filters you apply to the dropped visit list in the Gantt chart view will remain intact as you switch between vehicles and revisit the dropped visits. This feature ensures a streamlined workflow, eliminating the need to reset filters when you navigate the routing result.

### Improvement of Routing/Configuration - Introduction of Capacity Constraint Checkboxes

This update enables each hub to tailor their routing optimization by selectively choosing the constraints that best suit their needs. Below are the key improvements and new features included in this release:

1. **Individual Constraint Selection**:
    1. When you access the Routing/Configuration menu, you will find a checkbox next to each existing capacity constraint.
    2. This enhancement empowers users to customize their routing configurations by choosing specific constraints to include.

1. **Constraint Selection Limits**:
    1. To ensure a balanced and efficient routing optimization, the system limits the maximum number of checkboxes that can be selected for a single hub to 10.
    2. If you attempt to select the 11th checkbox, an alert message will prompt you, stating, "A maximum of 10 capacity constraints can be selected."
    3. It's important to note that organizations can now have more than ten (10) constraints, but the validation occurs when the user selects these constraints. The capacity constraint limit is set at 20 items, and exceeding this limit will trigger a message: "The capacity constraint has a maximum of 20 (twenty) items."

1. **Routing/Visit Menu**:
    1. In the Routing/Visit menu, you will now see only the constraints that have been checked in the Configuration menu. This ensures that only relevant constraints appear in the edit form.

1. **Routing/Vehicle Menu**:
    1. Similar to the Routing/Visit menu, the Routing/Vehicle menu now displays only the checked constraints in both the create and edit forms.

1. **Deletion Notifications**:
    1. When deleting a constraint, a notification will alert users to the potential impact on the organization.

**Important Note**: To edit these checkboxes, users are required to activate the "Edit Configuration" permission under the Route module in the Setting/Permission menu.

### Profile Menu Mobile Display Responsiveness Improvement

We've optimized the layout of the profile menu for mobile devices, ensuring a smoother and more intuitive user experience. The menu now adapts seamlessly to various screen sizes, offering a consistent and easy-to-navigate interface.

# v.3.70 Release

31 Oct
## Enhancement
### Time Deletion in Schedule Tasks
Previously, in the "Schedule" menu, you couldn't remove time for the first order if you had more than one time setting. Now, you have the ability to remove time from tasks within the schedule you are about to create or have already created.

### Enhanced Filter Management for Tasks and Automation
We are delighted to announce our latest improvement. We now automatically remove the filters you apply when creating, updating, or switching between hubs in the "Task" menu. The same applies when creating or updating automations in the "Automation" menu. We have made these changes to ensure that you can easily view task and automation data without any confusion. Your applied filters will no longer cause data to be hidden from the list, providing a clearer and more intuitive experience.

### Demo Data Notifications in Tracking and Schedule Menus
Now, our demo data notifications are also displayed in the Tracking and Schedule menus. This improvement is designed to provide clearer information to new MileApp users about the availability of demo data tasks, making it easier for users to explore and understand MileApp's functionality.

### Introducing Upfront Payment for New Subscribers and Plan Changes
We are continuously looking for ways to improve our services and offer more flexibility to our valued users. We are excited to announce a change in our payment mechanism for new subscribers, which will provide an upfront payment option for greater simplicity and convenience. Additionally, we're making adjustments to our plan offerings to better cater to your needs.

**Key Changes:**
1. **New Plan Structure**: We are introducing an updated plan structure with options that better align with your requirements. The plans include:
    *   **Free Plan**: A basic plan with essential features that you can use at no cost.
    *   **Paid Plan**: A feature-rich plan with additional capabilities, priced affordably to meet the needs of growing businesses.
    *   **Enterprise Plan**: A comprehensive plan designed for larger enterprises with advanced tools.
2. **Pricing Adjustments**: To accommodate the updated plan structure, pricing changes have been made for the Paid plans. We believe these changes provide better value for the features and support you receive with each plan.
3. **Cost Calculator**: We're introducing a new cost calculator that allows you to predict the costs associated with your usage of tasks, routing, and automation. This tool will help you estimate and plan your expenses more effectively.

**Important Notes:**
The upfront payment option for new subscribers and the updated plan structure will be in effect from November 1, 2023. Existing clients will not experience any changes to their billing cycle or payment method.
In addition to our billing upfront release, we've also made changes to the "Role" feature. When registering a new account, you will now have three custom roles in addition to the "Owner" role. These roles, namely "Admin," "Planner," and "Field User," can be renamed and deleted, except for the "Owner" role. Please note that these changes will not impact accounts registered before this billing release.

**Questions and Support:**
If you have any questions or need assistance with this change, our customer support team is ready to help. Contact us at [support@mile.app](mailto:support@mile.app) for any inquiries.

### Improved Menu Setting User with Information Hub in Team Selection

When a user opens the Team dropdown, they will now see a clear indicator denoting which hub each team belongs to. This feature will assist users in quickly identifying the hub affiliation of a particular team.

### Improvement in Export Routing Result

With this update, we have made two significant improvements to the export process.
1. **Unallowed Character Handling in Vehicle Names**
You no longer need to worry about validating vehicle names for unallowed characters during the export. Instead, we will now automatically remove these characters for you. This change simplifies the export process, saving you time and effort while ensuring your data remains accurate and clean.
1. **Prefix for Duplicated Vehicle Names**
Now, when you export your data, each sheet will come with an appended prefix, such as -1, -2, and so on. This simple but effective addition allows you to export results with the same vehicle names from the past without any conflicts. Your historical data remains intact.

### Responsive Display for MileApp Field Downloads
We now provide support for a responsive display of MileApp Field download information. This enables you to access it effortlessly using mobile devices and other screens, ensuring a better experience while navigating our application.

08 Nov
## Enhancement
### Setting/Permission Menu Improvement

In this release, we have added a permission validation feature to the Setting/Permission Menu. This new functionality simplifies the process of managing permissions and ensures that they remain consistent and logical.
Here's what you can expect with this improvement: When a user activates a specific permission, the system will now automatically activate related permissions to ensure a seamless and coherent user experience. For example, if a user activates the "Add Task" permission, the "View Task" permission will also be automatically activated.

# v.3.75 Release

13 Nov
## Enhancement
### Enhanced Flow Deletion Handling for Permission Show Flow
Deleting a flow now automatically removes the associated permission for showing that flow. Previously, if you had the permission to show a flow when creating a task and later deleted the flow, it caused issues when adjusting permissions. This enhancement ensures a smoother experience by synchronizing the removal of the show flow permission when deleting a flow, preventing complications during permission adjustments.

### Enhanced Onboarding: Customizable Hub Pins with Drag-and-Drop Functionality
In the previous onboarding steps for creating hubs, there was no information available on the hub pinpoint. Now, we have added details to the hub address setup, informing users that hub pins can be customized through a convenient drag-and-drop feature.

# v.3.76 Release

15 Nov
## Enhancement
### Email Notification for Organization Deletion
Owners will now receive an email notification upon successfully deleting their organization. This feature aims to enhance user engagement by keeping users informed about important actions taken on their accounts.

### Improved Flow Configuration Handling for Deleted Data Types
Previously, deleting a configured data type within a flow and its associated data source caused issues when creating tasks using that flow. We've adjusted this functionality so that deleting a configured data type within a flow no longer disrupts normal operations. Everything will continue to function as expected even after the deletion, ensuring smoother task management within flows.

### Enhanced Task Detail View with Interactive Expected Coordinate Link
Now, within the task detail view, you can directly click on the expected coordinate to visualize its location on Google Maps. This improvement allows for clearer verification and precise location confirmation of the expected coordinate point, ensuring better accuracy and understanding of its position.

### Improved Functionality in 'Create or Update Data Source' Automation
We've modified the behavior of the 'Create or Update Data Source' automation feature. Now, when utilizing this feature with restricted access data sources, if the 'Auto Limit Data Access' toggle is inactive and the 'Limit Data by User' dropdown remains empty, there will be no alteration in the access rights of that particular data source. Previously, if the toggle was inactive and the dropdown was left empty, the access rights of the data source were updated to include all users within the associated hub.

# v.3.76.1 Release

17 Nov
## Bug Fix
### Menu Setting/Permission Role Selection

In previous versions, users experienced an unexpected behavior where the focus would suddenly shift to another role when selecting a specific role in the menu settings. This issue resulted in an inconvenience for users trying to manage and configure permissions.

# v.3.77 Release

20 Nov
## Enhancement

### Create New Role with Predefined Permissions

This enhancement is aimed at streamlining your user experience and reducing the manual configuration effort. With this release, you can now create custom roles more efficiently by selecting from a list of existing pre-set roles, which automatically assigns predefined permissions to your new custom role.

**Key Features**:

1\. **Predefined Permissions Selection**

As a user, when you click on the "New" button to create a new custom role, you will now be presented with the option to choose from a list of existing pre-set roles as an optional step during the role creation process.

2\. **Activation of Default Permissions**

When you select a pre-set role from the list, the system will automatically activate permissions according to the default role settings during the initial registration. This means you will receive the exact set of permissions that the selected pre-set role offers at the time of creation, regardless of any subsequent edits made to that role.

3\. **Single Pre-Set Role Selection**

To maintain simplicity and avoid conflicts, you can choose only one pre-set role from the list. When you submit your selection, the system will instantly assign the permissions associated with that pre-set role to the new custom role you are creating.

4\. **Manual Configuration Option**

If you prefer not to select any pre-set roles, you can continue to create the custom role with no predefined permissions. This option allows you to manually configure the permissions from scratch, providing complete flexibility for your specific needs.

We believe that this improvement will save you valuable time and effort in setting up custom roles, making your experience with MileApp even more user-friendly and efficient.

### Enhanced User Invitation Email

Previously, when sending an invitation email to a new user, the displayed user name in the email would reflect the name of the invited user. Now, the user name presented in the invitation email will now accurately represent the person extending the invitation—the inviting user.

### Enhanced Menu Setting/Permission - Role List

The "Owner" role has been elevated to a prominent position, always appearing at the top of the role list.

# v.3.78 Release

21 Nov
## Enhancement
###   

### Improved Task Creation with Number Input Type in Flows
We have made improvements to task creation using flows that have a number input type component in this update. Previously, if you filled in the number input type component using a decimal value, the format had to be written using a period (.). If you used a comma, an "invalid format" message would appear. Now, we make it easier for you if you provide a comma separator, the system will automatically change it to a period. This enhancement is expected to improve user efficiency and provide a more convenient experience.

### Enhanced Viewing of Automation Response Information
We have made changes to improve the viewing of automation response information in the Automation menu. Previously, if you wanted to see the response information from your automation, the display would be cut off, making the information unclear. We have now updated this display. You can now view detailed response information by clicking on the eye icon. This will open a popup displaying the detailed response information, providing a clearer and more comprehensive view of your automation responses.

### Enhanced Efficiency in Modifying Start Time and End Time for Multiple Tasks

We are excited to announce a new enhancement in the Routing/Vehicle menu that allows users to input vehicle names with more than 30 characters. In response to user feedback and evolving needs, we understand the importance of flexibility in naming conventions.

**Key Feature: Extended Vehicle Name Length Support**

1\. Users can now enter vehicle names exceeding the previous limit of 30 characters in the Routing/Vehicle menu.

2\. Excel Export Enhancement:

In the event that a vehicle name surpasses the 30-character threshold and users choose to export the routing data, the system will handle the sheet naming process. The export functionality will automatically truncate the sheet name to retain only the maximum allowed characters for Excel sheets.

### Enhancement Routing/Configuration Menu

These updates focus on refining the interactions related to Clustering, Use All Vehicle, Return to Base, and Multi Trip configurations.

1\. **Clustering**:

\- Clustering: Enable this option to group nearby visits into clusters, optimizing routes by minimizing the distance and time traveled between locations.
\- When Clustering is checked, the "Use All Vehicle" option is now automatically disabled to avoid redundancy and ensure a more streamlined route planning process.

2\. **Use All Vehicle**:

\- Use All Vehicle: Ensure that every selected vehicle is assigned at least one route.
\- Note: When "Clustering" is active, the "Use All Vehicle" option is automatically disabled. This adjustment prevents potential conflicts and ensures a more efficient utilization of resources when Clustering is in use.

3\. **Return to Base**:

\- Return to Base: Select this option to make vehicles return to the hub after completing all visits in their assigned route.
\- This option is now automatically activated when "Multi Trip" is enabled, ensuring that vehicles consistently return to the hub between trips for reloading.

4\. **Multi Trip**:

\- Multi Trip: Enable this option to have vehicles perform multiple routes, optimizing the use of limited vehicles.
\- Vehicles will now automatically return to the hub for reloading between trips when "Multi Trip" is active. The "Return to Base" option will be automatically checked, providing a seamless and efficient reloading process between trips.

**Tooltip Text Enhancements**:

This allows users to seamlessly adjust settings on each page without losing sight of the mobile preview.

### Improved MileField App Display on Non-Responsive Pages
Previously, when attempting to view the MileField App display on a non-responsive page using a mobile device, the MileField App interface wouldn't appear. We've now enhanced this functionality, enabling you to display it seamlessly even on pages that do not support responsiveness. Now, regardless of the page's responsive support, you can still bring up the MileField App interface on your mobile device.

### Enhanced Flow Validation in Automation Menu
We've implemented validation to prevent the deletion of flows that are actively used in the automation detail menu. This enhancement ensures the seamless operation of your automation processes without any interruptions. Now, flows that are in use cannot be deleted, safeguarding the continuity of your automation workflows and preventing potential disruptions.

### Enhancement on Deleting Organization Process: All Users Receive Email Notification

We are excited to announce an enhancement to our platform that ensures better communication and awareness when organizations are deleted. Previously, only the organization owner would receive an email notification in such instances.

For users with a team:
1. Can view tasks of users without a team.
2. Only visible to their own team or users without a team.
3. Cannot assign users to a different team.
4. Can assign users without a team.

We hope that with this enhancement to the team feature, you can effectively utilize it to meet your specific needs.

### Enhanced Billing Menu for International Support and Improved UI/UX

We're excited to announce a significant update to MileApp's billing system, enhanced support for our international users and to elevate the overall user interface and experience. This release encompasses several improvements:

**Changes**:
1. When users outside of Indonesia verify their MileApp accounts, the system will automatically switch to displaying currency in USD (United States Dollar).
2. International users now have the convenience of making upfront payments using their credit cards.
3. We've added the USA to the country options in the verification form. Users in the United States can now seamlessly verify their MileApp accounts, facilitating a smoother onboarding process for our American users.

This feature provides a dynamic marker that clearly indicates where your visit will be placed as you move it left or right within the chart.

### Menu Routing Improvement

To enhance readability and make navigation more efficient, we have implemented an improved ellipsis feature for long vehicle names. When a vehicle name exceeds the available space, an ellipsis (...) will now be displayed, indicating that the name is truncated. Additionally, users can hover over the ellipsis to reveal a tooltip displaying the complete vehicle name. This ensures that users can easily identify and select the desired vehicle, even when names are lengthy.

### Unified Data Type Handling in Select Components

We have addressed the impact resulting from the change in data types within the select component. Previously, it utilized a string data type for single select and an array of strings for multiple select. Now, we have streamlined it to utilize a singular data type, which is an array of strings for both single and multiple select options.

To accommodate this data type transition, adjustments have been made within the Flow/Configuration menu, Automation, Tasks, and Scheduling. We believe that these adjustments will enhance the usability of your mileApp experience.

### Enhanced User Selection in Data Source Menu

We've improved the user selection process within the Data Source menu. Now, you can smoothly select users, even if you have more than 2000 users. This enhancement ensures a seamless experience while using mileApp

### Expanded Content Display Options with URL View Component

Previously, you could only display clickable URLs. Now, you can showcase videos, images, and PDFs using the URL view component. This enhancement allows you to tailor mileApp to better suit your specific needs.

### Enhanced Data Source Options: Common Data Type

Previously, you could only create unique data source types per hub. Now, you have an additional option: the common data type, designed for the entire organization rather than being unique per hub.
Please note that when setting up the common data type, you can only define it during the initial data type creation. Once the data type is created, you cannot modify it. Please consider this before creating the data type.

To eliminate any ambiguity and provide a more intuitive experience, we have renamed the plan formerly known as "Paid" to "Pro."

### Menu Setting/Permission Improvement

We have revised the wording within the Permissions section to provide a clearer and more intuitive user interface. Specifically, we have replaced the term "Add..." with "Create..." across all Permission settings.

### Privacy Policy Display Optimization

In the previous version, some users were encountering the privacy policy prompt twice – first during successful verification and then upon signing in again after the initial sign-out.

We have implemented changes to ensure that the privacy policy is now displayed only once under these circumstances. This improvement aims to reduce redundancy and make the acceptance process more straightforward for our users.

### Enhanced Hub Location Selection in the Onboarding Process

In the onboarding process, users can now select their hub location by dragging and dropping or by clicking the desired location on the map. This action relocates the hub pin to the selected area, making it easier for users to designate their preferred hub location.

### Data Mapping Enhancement in Automation Types 'Create Task' and 'Create and Assign Task'
In the 'Create Task' and 'Create and Assign Task' automation types, mapping data is now restricted to components sharing the same data type. For instance, exclusively mapping between a text input component and another text input or between selected components. This restriction prevents potential issues from mapping data with differing data types, ensuring smoother automation processes.

## Important Announcement

### Update on Mobile Task Sorting Mechanism
**On December 26, 2023**, we're introducing an update that modifies the task sorting mechanism on the mobile version using 'orderIndex.' Previously, the orderIndex had a maximum of 15 digits. With this update, we've adjusted the maximum to 11 digits. Please note, the existing data's orderIndex will remain unchanged. The new orderIndex calculation will affect tasks created after the release.

The orderIndex is utilized to sequence . If you don't define an orderIndex, the system will automatically generate it with a maximum of 11 digits. However, you can also assign a specific orderIndex value to suit your needs for sorting tasks with integer data types.

While this change may cause slight ambiguity or irregularity between existing and newly created tasks, rest assured, its impact on overall functionality is minimal. You may experience this for 1 to 2 days post-update. We apologize for any inconvenience caused. Should you have any concerns or inquiries, don't hesitate to get in touch with us.

Please note that this adjustment might cause slight irregularities in the task sequence for mobile data— existing tasks may exhibit differences compared to the newly created ones for the next 1 – 2 days. Rest assured, this change is not expected to impact other functionalities significantly.

### Enhanced User Registration Notification
When a new user registers with an email that is already in use, the information will now appear directly below the email field. Previously, if account creation failed due to the email being registered with another organization, an information message appeared in the top right corner. This change aims to ensure users can more easily notice the displayed information messages.

### Enhanced Automation Selection for Task Creation and Assignment
We have improved the user experience in the automation menu, specifically with the 'On Task Created' and 'On Task Finished' events, combined with the 'Create and Assign Task' Automation Type. Previously, users had to enable the 'Auto Assign Task' toggle to perform automatic assignments based on Assignee, Assigned By, or Done by fields. We've removed this toggle, enabling users to directly choose values for Assignee, Assigned By, or Done by within the Assignee field. This streamlines the process of setting up automation selections.

### Improved Currency Component Display
When creating tasks within a flow featuring a currency component, we've made it easier for you to view the inputted currency. We've now added automatic separators to your currency components.

### Improved Validation for Option Fields in Data Source
In this update, we've implemented validation in the data source menu, specifically when creating data types and fields with an 'option' type. Previously, when adding a field with the 'Option' type, you could submit the data type without filling in the Option value. This caused confusion when creating a data source with an option field lacking values. Now, we've introduced validation requiring the Option value to be filled in

In this update, we have implemented additional validation when creating tasks using a mapped flow with a connected data source, specifically when utilizing the "Create or Update Data Source" automation. This validation is implemented specifically for the primary key field when creating both single and multiple tasks.

The purpose of this validation is to minimize potential failures in your automation processes, particularly when incorrect characters are entered into the primary key field. This improvement ensures a more robust and error-resistant experience when working with automation tasks linked to data sources.

However, with these changes, you don't need to modify the settings you've already configured, you can continue using them according to your existing settings.

## Bug Fix
### Bug Fix: Correct Handling of Numeric Visit Names in Exported Results
Previously, when the visit name was only composed of numerical characters and exported to Excel, a formatting discrepancy occurred. Despite being intended as text, the exported result was being interpreted as a numerical value, resulting in the insertion of commas. This unintended conversion disrupted the expected output format.

### Fixed Issue with API-Generated Tasks and "Do Task" Icon
We've addressed an issue with creating tasks via API, which resulted in the "Do Task" icon always appearing in the web interface, even when the task wasn't assigned to the assigned user. We have now fixed this problem so that the "Do Task" icon will only appear when opening the web interface and viewing tasks assigned to the respective user.

### Fixed Issue with Media Tab Display for Photo Component

Note that the visit group value is used solely for routing optimization and will not be sent during the dispatch process. For more details, please refer to our [documentation](https://doc.clickup.com/3837933/p/h/3n3zd-81962/aa00834626ae24f/3n3zd-245116).
### Improved Move Visit Functionality in Routing/Result Menu
In this update, we have enhanced the move visit functionality to provide better clarity and usability for users.

This addition allows users to double-check which visit they are reassigning before proceeding to submit the changes.

2. The alignment of main options, such as Auto Split, within the routing configuration has been improved. Previously, associated type options were aligned directly under the main option. Now, these types of options are indented to the right, appearing as nested radio buttons. This adjustment enhances the visual hierarchy and clarity, making it easier to distinguish between main options and their respective types.

Previously, the tooltip text for the "History" icon appeared on the left side when the icon was hovered over, while the tooltip texts for "Full Screen," "Minimize," and "Close" appeared above their respective icons. This inconsistency often caused the "History" tooltip to cover the adjacent "Export" button. With the latest enhancement, the tooltip text for the "History" icon now appears above the icon, consistent with the tooltips for the other icons.
### Improvement: Rename Result in Routing/Result Menu
When editing names in the Routing/Result menu, pressing Enter on the keyboard will immediately save the changes.

This feature allows you to set recurring schedules with customizable intervals, giving you the flexibility to skip specific periods. For instance, you can now create schedules that occur every 2 days or once a week, depending on your needs. We hope this enhancement improves your experience and provides greater control over your scheduling preferences.

We have updated the "View Invoice Detail" icon for consistency and improved user experience.

## Important Announcement
### Task Data Validation Implementation
We would like to notify you about a change in the implementation date for the upcoming task data validation update. The implementation, **originally scheduled for November 25, 2024, has been rescheduled to December 2, 2024**. Starting from this new date, tasks created or updated via the API will not be saved if the data sent is not registered as a component in the flow.

We hope this extended timeline allows you additional time to review your configurations and make any necessary adjustments to ensure a smooth transition.

For your reference, here is a reminder of the update details:
If you create or modify task data using API and include data or keys that are not registered as components within your Flow, these additional fields will no longer be saved.

Example:
*   There is a delivery flow, and you create a task, then send deliveryStatus data. However, if the deliveryStatus component is not present in the flow configuration, then the deliveryStatus data sent via the API will not be saved.

This update may significantly affect tasks created or modified via API. However, tasks created or modified through MileApp’s web or mobile app (MileApp Field), or tasks updated via API with data that aligns with your configured flow, will not be impacted and will continue to function as normal.

For any concerns or further assistance, feel free to reach out to us. Thank you for your attention.

# Getting Started



# Creating A Hub

Hub is an essential element in managing tasks within an organization as It acts as the **parent** for tasks, which means it is required to create them. Without a hub, tasks cannot be initiated.

In most cases, A hub can represent a warehouse, distribution center, office, or place that act as the center of your operation.

Organizations have the flexibility to create **multiple** hubs depending on their requirements.

Each hub will hold tasks that are segregated according to their respective hubs. This ensures that tasks are appropriately managed and that any changes or updates are done in an organized manner.

Users can be assigned to one hub or more, depending on the tasks they are responsible for. This feature enables effective communication and collaboration among team members, ensuring tasks are completed efficiently and on time.

You can **switch** between hubs from the top right corner of almost any page
![](https://t3837933.p.clickup-attachments.com/t3837933/076cb89b-207f-4b6f-a140-9a5050b306c8/image.png)

Overall, the hub plays a critical role in managing tasks, and its proper utilization can significantly improve an organization's productivity.

You are required to create your first hub when you first register your account, after which you can create, edit and delete hubs from the [Setting➝Hub](https://web.mile.app/setting/hub) page

![](https://t3837933.p.clickup-attachments.com/t3837933/8cca7d6d-cbfc-4336-99eb-d60f0bed7cfc/image.png)
_Creating a hub from the Setting➝Hub page_

You can configure which user gets access to which Hub from the Setting➝User page, This page also allows you to invite new users and configure their role

![](https://t3837933.p.clickup-attachments.com/t3837933/dc9f9624-b71d-498e-bb91-3222c728ac34/image.png)
_Managing user role and hub from the Setting➝User page_

More details about the hub can be found [here](https://app.clickup.com/3837933/v/dc/3n3zd-38402/3n3zd-162662).

# Creating A Flow

Flow is the process flow of a task, it defines the information that can be **viewed** and **filled** by the user in a task, this information is segregated into **pages**, and each page can have several **components** that is suited the field process

MileApp lets you create a flow from scratch or edit one from an existing template from the [Flow](https://web.mile.app/flow/flow) page, some commonly used flows are
*   Delivery
*   Pickup
*   Inspection
*   Canvassing
*   Field Sales

MileApp has many ready-to-use editable templates to start with

![](https://t3837933.p.clickup-attachments.com/t3837933/77d9bc3f-1730-43d3-989b-f8baac31b492/image.png)
_Creating a flow from an existing template from the Flow page_

![](https://t3837933.p.clickup-attachments.com/t3837933/d543fe10-e6e6-4936-ab8f-f104b07c7f0b/image.png)
_Various flow templates to start with_

Once you have created a flow from a template or a new one from scratch, you can start editing its pages and components

## Pages
The types of pages are
*   **Initial Page** ➝ This page is shown to the user when the task is first created, all input information on this page needs to be filled in when the task is created, there can be only 1 Initial Page
*   **Normal Page** ➝ These pages are shown to the user when the task is being done, you can add multiple pages by using the **Add Page** button

![](https://t3837933.p.clickup-attachments.com/t3837933/572c83f6-9507-47e0-9966-035213acb958/Flow.png)

Why is the Initial Page important?
The normal life cycle of a task is
1. **Task Created** ➝ When the task is first created by the admin or field user
2. **Task Assigned** ➝ When the task is being assigned by admin to the field user
3. **Task Done** ➝ When the task is being done by the field user

In most cases, the user that creates the task is different from the one doing it _(for example, the admin creates the task, assigns it to the field user, and then the field user does the task),_ therefore Initial page distinguishes information to be inputted by the admin from the field user

MileApp also allows the task to be created directly by the user doing it, skipping the assignment part altogether, in cases such this, the initial page doesn't have any difference from the other pages
## Components
Each page can have 1 or more components to be used by the users, the types of components are
*   **View** ➝ View component lets user to show information, it can be of various types with a unique property, for example, a view of the type coordinate can be clicked to show its location on the map
*   **Input** ➝ Input component is used for the user to fill information such as text, time or currency data
*   **Select** ➝ Select component is used for the user to input a choice from selection, it can be configured between button, checkbox or dropdown type
*   **Photo** ➝ Photo component enables user to take photo from android or iOS devices
*   **Signature** ➝ Signature component will be shown as signature pad where user can draw their signature

# Using Demo Data

With Demo Data, you'll get a glimpse of what MileApp has to offer, right from your Dashboard to the Routing/Vehicle and Task menus.

# Dashboard

As a new user, this feature is designed to help you get a quick grasp of what the Dashboard has to offer. Here, you will find sample demo data if you meet the following criteria:
*   You are a new user who **registered** less than 1 month ago.
*   Your task usage is still at 0.
The demo data has been carefully created to provide a realistic representation of what your Dashboard could look like with real task information. It is visually appealing and meant to give you an immediate understanding of the Dashboard's features.
## Welcome Banner
A welcoming banner will be displayed, showing "Welcome to MileApp! We provide you with demo data to enhance your MileApp experience. Demo data will be cleared once you create your first task. **Create a task** now or **Watch a video** tutorial." You can hover over the 'i' icon on the banner to get additional information. It will inform you that if you don't create a task within 30 days, the demo data will be automatically cleared to keep your dashboard fresh.
## Automatic Removal of Dummy Data
As soon as you **create your first task** within MileApp, the demo data will be automatically removed from the Dashboard. Additionally, if you **have not created a task within 30 days**, the demo data will also be cleared.
The deleted Demo Data **will not be saved in the Trash**. Therefore, you will not be able to retrieve or view the deleted demo data in the Menu Settings/Trash. It is permanently removed from your MileApp account.
## Additional Information
*   **Data Display:**
    *   The Dashboard will display data from the last 7 days based on your login date.
    *   The filter flow can be set to show all default flow options.
*   **Flow Selection:** The flow filter will only display the flow options you selected during account verification.
*   **Date Filters:** By default, the filter date automatically selects the last 7 days, but you can choose other dates. However, the displayed results will always be the same.
*   **Hub Data:** Regardless of the hub you filter, the demo data will always appear the same, as it is associated with the hub you created during verification.

# Registration & Verification (sudah di copy ke yang utama)



# Register to MileApp

## Organization Set up
If you are the first user from your Organization to register to the MileApp when you are registering your account to our [website](https://web.mile.app/) you will also set up your Organization info along with your account in one process. But, if your organization is already registered to the MileApp you could invite other users from the [Setting - User invite user feature](https://web.mile.app/setting/user) instead.

## Registration Process
There are 2 ways to register your email to MileApp, by using the Sign up with Google account button or sign up manually by inputting your email and password manually.

![](https://t3837933.p.clickup-attachments.com/t3837933/0aaa3f5f-1ae3-4b84-beca-8156de9305c8/image.png)

The difference between Sign up with Google button and the manual sign up is:
*   If you use the **Sign up with Google button** you will be redirected to our Verification page, and you could continue the process from there.
*   If you use the **manual Sign up method** you will need to confirm your email by clicking the activate button / copy the verification link on the email that we send to you before you could access the Verification page. This is the sample of the Verification email that you would receive after inputting your email & password at the manual sign up method:

![](https://t3837933.p.clickup-attachments.com/t3837933/40728859-b613-4ad3-b8fa-da229eeeecc3/image.png)

After you finish the Registration step by using your Google account or manual sign up method, you will need to Verify your information at our verification process.

# Verify your Information

The next step after you complete the Registration process is to fill in your information at our Verification process, this step is necessary to submit your Organization data to MileApp. This step will only be necessary if you are the first account to register to MileApp in your Organization.

## Verification Process
After registering using a Google account or manual sign-up, you’ll need to verify your organization information. The verification process consists of three steps that enable you to provide your personal and organization details.

The **first step** of verification is confirming your general information for your user account. You can edit your user information later in the User Settings page and Profile menu.
![](https://t3837933.p.clickup-attachments.com/t3837933/df7fa6b7-d6b8-48a2-9c91-65d20a0241e4/image.png)

*   **Full Name**: Enter your full name.
*   **Organization Name**: Enter your organization or company name. You can update this later under Settings > Organization.
*   **Country**: Select your country. If you choose Indonesia, the language will default to Indonesian upon sign-in; otherwise, it will be in English.

In the **second** step, set up your first hub. You can modify this later under Settings > Hub.

![](https://t3837933.p.clickup-attachments.com/t3837933/1cb35ec8-1199-49ad-8ce2-4b2489a0c836/image.png)

*   **Hub Name**: Name your first hub, such as "Warehouse 1."
*   **Hub Location**: Search for and select the hub location on the map.

In the **third** and final step, select the flow that best suits your business process. The flow defines the task process, determining what information users can view and fill in a task. Information is organized into pages, with each page containing components tailored to the field process. You can further customize the flow later on the MileApp web platform after completing verification.

![](https://t3837933.p.clickup-attachments.com/t3837933/1bbcd682-f4cb-4437-899c-d54262435ab5/image.png)

_Flow Display Menu_

[**Flow**](https://web.mile.app/flow/flow) in MileApp is the mobile field application workflow, setting it correctly is critical to the success of the field workers in doing their job efficiently. Flow defines how information is presented to the field workers and what data they need to fill in and update on the mobile app.

An organization is allowed to create an unlimited number of Flows, regardless of its license plan, enabling it to utilize MileApp for various field operations. For instance, an organization acting as a distributor can use MileApp for pickup, delivery, and field sales. However, each Flow has a component limit based on the organization’s license plan:
*   Free: 50 components
*   Basic: 100 components
*   Pro: 200 components
*   Enterprise: As needed

Components are the building blocks of flow, MileApp comes with various components that can be used in a flow such as:
*   View component ➝ used to present information to user in the form of text, image, link, date, etc.
*   Input component ➝ used to give input
*   Select component ➝ used to give options
*   Photo component ➝ used to capture image from camera
*   Signature component ➝ used to verify identity
*   Bill component ➝ Used to display and manage billing information
*   List component ➝ Used to display and manage of information in a list format
*   Timer component ➝ used to track the duration of a task
*   Voice Note component ➝ Used to record audio
*   Capture component ➝ Used to capturing data

# How to Build a Flow

*   View Flow
*   Create Flow

![](https://t3837933.p.clickup-attachments.com/t3837933/84d13558-01eb-4814-9092-c392de4fd521/image.png)
_Flow Menu Display_

Flow settings are managed within the Pages & Configuration tab. You can only create or edit flow settings through the web interface. To create a new flow, click the New Flow button (1).
The information you configure in the flow settings may appear in the web app, the mobile app, or both, depending on the flow type.

Creating a flow from scratch will provide you with a blank flow that can be fully customized to suit your needs. However, for first-time users, we do not recommend starting with a blank flow, as it requires a basic understanding of how to properly configure a flow.

We have also provided several ready-to-use flows that are pre-generated and automatically set up when you register your account. You can either use them as they are or customize them to suit your needs:
*   Pickup
*   Delivery
*   Field Sales
*   Field Canvassing
*   Home Cleaning
*   House Inspection
We advise first-time users to explore the ready-to-use flows or flow templates before creating one from scratch.

# Capture Component

The Capture component can be used to capture the current date in the MileField App when a field user is performing tasks. Currently, only the Date Time type is supported.
![](https://t3837933.p.clickup-attachments.com/t3837933/d157d499-5489-4138-afdc-99bbe96e62ce/image.png)

# Configuration

![](https://t3837933.p.clickup-attachments.com/t3837933/fa372725-2336-4575-af1f-e6f50ad9a1b4/8.png)
Configuration is needed to make sure the component from the Flow are mapped correctly when you use it to create a Task.

For example, the essential component that you need for Route Optimization is VisitName, Address, and Coordinate at the Routing configuration, if you set this correctly, the task that you create with this flow would be suitable for Route Optimization.

See the breakdown of each part of the flow's configuration settings in the subpage.

# Task List

Configuration setting in the Task list will affect how a task is shown on the Task page, for example, you could use the customer name for the Title, the address of the customer for the Content, etc. You could choose any compatible component for this list based on your needs.

![](https://t3837933.p.clickup-attachments.com/t3837933/e6b8bc17-4b17-46a8-9cde-296288625a4b/11.png)
1. The component title that you choose here will become the Task title in the task list
2. The component title that you choose here will become the Content title in the task list
3. The component title that you choose here will become the Label title in the task list

# Routing

Route configuration is a crucial step when creating tasks that are suitable for Route Optimization within your workflow. While route configuration is optional, we strongly recommend configuring at least three essential fields for visit details: Visit Name, Address, and Coordinate. Without this configuration, you can still perform routing optimization, but the values will not be saved to the data task.

Please note that only compatible components can be chosen for routing configuration.

![](https://t3837933.p.clickup-attachments.com/t3837933/2e23f8fc-8210-4741-8d93-e517017c92af/10.png)
1. Visit Name
    *   The component selected as Visit Name will be displayed as the "Name" on a Visit.
    *   Only input components with the type "Text" can be chosen as the Visit Name.
    *   If this field is left empty, the name of the visit will be taken from the Title in the Task List configuration.
2. Address
    *   The component selected as Address will be shown as the "Address" on a Visit.
    *   Only input components with the type "Address" can be chosen as the Address.
    *   If this field is left empty, the address will be empty in the visit details, and you will need to input it manually for each visit
3. Open Time
    *   The component chosen as Open Time will be displayed as the "Open Time" on a Visit.
    *   Open Time represents the start of the desired time window for executing the visit.
    *   Only input components with the type "Time" can be chosen as Open Time.
4. Close Time
    *   The component chosen as Close Time will be displayed as the time below the Open Time on a Visit.
    *   Close Time represents the end of the desired time window for executing the visit.
    *   Only input components with the type "Time" can be chosen as Close Time.
5. Visit Duration
    *   The component chosen as Visit Duration will be displayed as the "Visit Time" on a Visit.
    *   Visit Time represents the idle time in minutes after reaching each visit.
    *   Only input components with the type "Number" can be chosen as Visit Duration.
    *   Please note that the value for visit time must be an integer, as it represents minutes.
6. Coordinate
    *   The component chosen as Coordinate will be shown as the "Coordinate" on a Visit.
    *   We highly recommend using the Input component with the type "Coordinate" and activating the "Geocode" feature. This ensures accurate mapping of the visit's location on the map.
7. Tags
    *   The component selected as Tags will be shown as the "Visit tags" on a Visit.
    *   Visit tags are used to pair visits with vehicles or other relevant criteria. This is essential for optimizing routes by matching tags, thereby ensuring efficient assignments.
    *   Only input components with the type "Text" or "Select" can be chosen as Tags. You can use text input or a selection list to assign appropriate tags to visits.
These capacity constraints provide you with the ability to define and track specific attributes related to your visits, such as weight, volume, and width. By using these constraints, you can ensure that the capacity and physical requirements of each visit are taken into account during the route optimization process. **Please note that the available constraint options may vary depending on the configuration set in the Routing/Configuration menu, and the values entered can be decimal with a maximum of 1 number after the comma.**

1. Constraint: Weight
    *   The component chosen as Constraint Weight will be displayed as "Weight" on a Visit. This can be used to represent the total weight (Kg) of items included in the visit.
    *   Only input components with the type "Number" or "Currency" can be selected as the Constraint Weight.
2. Constraint: Volume
    *   The component chosen as Constraint Volume will be displayed as the "Volume" of a Visit. This can be used to represent the total volume (m³) of items included in the visit.
    *   Only input components with the type "Number" or "Currency" can be selected as the Constraint Volume.
3. Constraint: Width
    *   The component chosen as Constraint Width will be displayed as the "Width" of a Visit. This can be used to represent the total width (m) of items included in the visit.
    *   Only input components with the type "Number" or "Currency" can be selected as the Constraint Width.

Please note that if a component is already chosen for one of the fields, it will not be available for selection in any other fields. For example, if you select the "Invoice" component as the "Visit Name," then "Invoice" will not be visible as an option for any other field, such as "Tag."
By configuring these routing settings, you can ensure that your route optimization process operates smoothly and that visit details are accurately recorded in your tasks.

# Time

Time configuration could be used to set the Start and the End time of a Task.

![](https://t3837933.p.clickup-attachments.com/t3837933/9f032c64-f8bc-4b83-b86e-fb33564dd568/9.png)
1. Start Time will define when a Task should be started to work on by the Field user, you could set it based on your needs, the default value is 0 hours from the time the Task is created, so by default a Task could be started right away after it is created.
2. End Time will define the deadline of a Task, you could set it based on your needs, the default value is 24 hours from the time the Task is started, so with default configuration, if you create a Task it will expire in 24 hours.

# Data Source

A data source is a feature that enables you to utilize data when creating or working on tasks. To use a data source, you must map the component flow with the data source on the Configuration Tab.

![](https://t3837933.p.clickup-attachments.com/t3837933/a08461d8-60a4-4898-be39-509ec70d949e/image.png)
_Data source settings with flow_

The data source can only be stored with input, list and bill components. Here's how to map component flows with data sources.

**Input component :**
![](https://t3837933.p.clickup-attachments.com/t3837933/2c013352-b9a9-40f1-8b6d-910bd701a732/image.png)
_Mapping Input Components with Data Sources_

Here are the explanations for each number on the image:
1. Component Using Data Source: If you select an input component, you have the option to map a data source to each of these components. Furthermore, this component will also serve as the primary key in points 3 and 3.a.
2. Type of Data Source Used: Here, you need to choose the type of data source that will be utilized in this process.
3. Component Mapped with Primary Key Data Source: This component will be linked to the primary key of the chosen data source. The component that's mapped will also act as a trigger to select the data source when creating or working on tasks. The information in this field will be automatically populated after you map the component in point number one.
4. Component Mapped with Data Source

Please make sure to refer to the image above while following the steps mentioned to effectively utilize this feature. Should you have any further questions, feel free to contact our support team.

_Mapping List Components with Data Sources_

Here are the explanations for the numbers on the image:
1. Selected Data Source Type: When choosing a data source type, ensure that the selected type has a Text field available for mapping with "Item Name," and a Number field available for mapping with "Item Qty."
2. Reserved Key "Item Name" and Text Field Type: Please note that the reserved key "Item Name" can only be mapped with a data source that has a Text field type. Ensure that you correctly map it according to the required field type.
3. Reserved Key "Item Qty" and Number Field Type: Similarly, the reserved key "Item Qty" can only be mapped with a data source that has a Number field type. Make sure to select the appropriate field type when mapping "Item Qty."

Please refer to the provided image while following the explanations above. If you have any further questions, feel free to reach out to our support team.

The bill component, it's quite similar to the list component, with the addition of one required reserved key to be mapped, which is "Item Price." Also, regarding the item price, it can only be mapped with a data source that has a Number field type.

[**Task Menu**](https://web.mile.app/tasks/task) is a central place for you to manage tasks, add a new task, import bulk tasks, assign tasks to a field user, check the status of each task, view details of each task, and export task reports. You could also monitor ongoing tasks and create a scheduled task from this menu.

# Introduction to Task

The Task is the core of MileApp, most of MileApp features are revolved around or started from a Task.

![](https://t3837933.p.clickup-attachments.com/t3837933/1f6375e8-b34e-4b98-a5f6-ce9ad0925a2f/Task%20as%20a%20Core.png)
*   Task enables you to manage your field user, for example, you could assign a Task to a Field user, after it was assigned they will see it on their mobile apps & could work on it through the apps.
*   Another example is, if you create a Task that is suitable for Route Optimization, you could optimize the visit route and your field user could work on it through their mobile apps.
*   Using a more advanced Task feature, you could create a task that is interconnected by using the Automation or Schedule feature.
*   You could set up a custom Flow for a Task based on your needs. The flow would also affect the mobile apps, so you could specify what your Field user could do when they work on the Task.

# Creating Task

There are few ways to create a Task, you could input or import it manually, create a scheduled task based on your needs, or generate it from the automation feature.

![](https://t3837933.p.clickup-attachments.com/t3837933/54c56e33-830a-4162-b71c-12d3f81c6d97/image.png)

# Tracking



# Introduction to Tracking

The Task Tracking system allows you to monitor the tracking history of a user over the last 24 hours, providing you with information about their location history, their completed and ongoing tasks, and the position of their Start and Finish.

We highly suggest that you activate our Start Finish feature to ensure that your user locations are recorded properly to be shown here on the Tracking page.

![](https://t3837933.p.clickup-attachments.com/t3837933/3df26056-9449-4e69-880c-a210bee07b6f/image.png)

## Set up the Start Finish Feature
The Task Tracking location histories will be generated properly if you activate the Start Finish feature from the [Permission page](https://web.mile.app/setting/permission). At the Start Finish feature setting you could define the recording interval of the user location history, and you could also define the radius around your hub that will only allow users to Start & Finish when they are around that radius distance from your hub.

This is where you set up the Start Finish feature:
1. Toggle to activate / deactivate this features
2. How often the coordinate of the MileApp Field user will be recorded
3. The radius around the hub where the MileApp Field user could start to accessing their task
4. The radius around the hub where the MileApp Field user could Finish to stopped accessing their task and stopped the coordinate recording

![](https://t3837933.p.clickup-attachments.com/t3837933/a236bc32-37a3-4090-b2c4-8e648494cfad/image.png)

For instance, you could set the coordinate recording interval to 5 minutes, which means the app will record the user's coordinates every 5 minutes.

Additionally, if you set the radius to 500 meters, the MileApp Field user could start accessing their task after they Start at 500 meters or less from the hub. The mobile app user will be able to access their task as long as they have Start.

This also applied to Finish radius of 500 meters, which requires users to be within 500 meters or less from the hub to Finish. After users are Finish, they have to Start again to access their tasks.

# General Information

There's plenty of information on the [Tracking page](https://web.mile.app/route/visit) that could help you to know the latest location of each user, know the status of each task, and see the last update time of the user & task.

The tracking page will show information from the current hub and the date that you choose. This is the list of information that you could find on the Tracking page.

## **General information**
This information will show you a summary of all users' information for that specific date, or if you haven't chosen a specific date, it will show today's date tracking history.

![](https://t3837933.p.clickup-attachments.com/t3837933/cf81cfd3-ccd9-4865-b70b-00bc29c6e2c5/image.png)
*   **Total User**

This counter for the Total user will show you the count of all Active & Inactive users in this Hub, this might not include some users in your organization, because the Tracking page will only show you user and location history from the active Hub that you choose.

*   **Total Done Task**

This counter will show you the total number of the Done Task from all user in the Hub, if this number show 7/7 Tasks as shown in the example above, it means that all of this day's task is done. But if it shows 0/7 Task, it means that there are still 7 Ongoing tasks on that day.

*   **Total Ongoing Task**

This counter will show you the total number of the Ongoing Task from all user in the Hub, if this number show 7/7 Tasks, it means that there are still 7 Ongoing task on that day. But if it shows 0/7 Task as shown in the example above, it means that all task on that day is Done.

*   **Total Travel Time**

This number is the total travel time of all users in the hub on that day, this number will only count the active user travel time.

*   **Total Travel Distance**

This number is the total travel distance of all users in the hub on that day, this number will only count the active user travel distance.

## Active User
The active user list will show users that have an active Task on that day. If you wish to see the detailed tracking history of each user, click on the user on the list to view their task & location detail.

### All Active User History
![](https://t3837933.p.clickup-attachments.com/t3837933/abb243d2-add5-43a4-bff0-d061a99f1a48/image.png) ![](https://t3837933.p.clickup-attachments.com/t3837933/110926fc-7d21-4d7f-9a21-082c671b69a8/image.png)
When you click this button, you will see all active user locations on the map view on the selected date. On the map, you will see multiple user icons that represent that user's current location.

This active user view will only show you the location of the user, if you wish to see the more detailed location history of each user, you should click and select the user on the list instead.

The Active user button will also show the current active user number on that day. You could collapse/expand the Active user list by clicking the arrow.

### Specific Active User History
If you wish to see the detailed location history of an active user, you should click their name first on the Active user list. After you choose a user, the map will show you a more detailed history of that user that include their current location, ongoing & done task location, and their start & finish location.

The planned route for the ongoing task & the actual route for the done task for this user will also be shown on the map.

![](https://t3837933.p.clickup-attachments.com/t3837933/cf98e016-cb63-474a-8fc4-d9ed3e19f995/image.png) ![](https://t3837933.p.clickup-attachments.com/t3837933/f9810117-75e5-45c0-a403-80c9831ef551/image.png)

## Inactive User
The inactive user list will show users that didn't have a task on that day. This list will only show you the name of the inactive user, so it can't be clicked because the inactive user didn't send any data that could be shown on the tracking map. You could collapse or expand the inactive user list by clicking the arrow on the right side.

![](https://t3837933.p.clickup-attachments.com/t3837933/4fd7cf46-b217-4e83-b4e6-290ee7238f14/image.png)

# Icons and Route Information

There are a few icons and information cards that you could find on the [Tracking page](https://web.mile.app/tasks/tracking) as your field user using the mobile app and finishing their task.

Some icons and cards will be displayed by default, while some will only be displayed if the user has done certain actions, if the task carries specific information, or after they Start or Finish their work.

## User Icon
The user icon will show you the latest location of the user on the map. You could click the user icon to show a card that contains more detail about the total task, done task, ongoing task, location history, and last updated information from that user. This information is visible both when you click a user icon on the all Active User view, or when you view a specific Active User activity after you click their name on the Active list.

![](https://t3837933.p.clickup-attachments.com/t3837933/7c8c0bbb-f435-4eed-9a06-faaf1982a260/image.png) ![](https://t3837933.p.clickup-attachments.com/t3837933/bb90681a-025e-4f34-ae79-d5ddb48015ca/image.png)
_All Active User view_ _Specific Active User view_

Detail explanation for each information on the information card:
*   **Last update**

The last update time is the most recent location history update from this user, the location history is generated when the user uses their mobile app and for better accuracy, you should use the [Start Finish feature](https://web.mile.app/setting/permission) so the location history could be generated properly.

*   **Total Task**

The total task counts both the Done & Ongoing tasks from that user on that specific date.

*   **Done Task**

The total amount of tasks that the user has finished on that specific date, the tracking page will show the finished task based on its Done time.

1. **Task Title**

This is generated from the task title, if the task title is not mapped at the [flow configuration](https://web.mile.app/flow/flow) setting. We will show the flow name as the title of this done task information card.

2. **Assignee**

The name of the user that finishes this task.

3. **Task Status**

Status of this task. "Done" means the task has been finished.

4. **Task Content**

Customizable task content that could be mapped at the [flow configuration](https://web.mile.app/flow/flow) setting. If the value is empty or the task content is not mapped, this content won't be shown.

5. **Task Label**

Customizable task label that could be mapped at the [flow configuration](https://web.mile.app/flow/flow) setting. If the value is empty or the task content is not mapped, this label won't be shown.

When you hover over the Ongoing Task icon that is dispatched from the route optimization. A tooltip will appear that will show you the estimated arrival time of this user, and if the user is estimated to be late at their next task location, we will show the estimation of how much is the delay.

This tooltip will appear if these two requirements are fulfilled:
*   The task has been optimized and dispatched from the [route optimization](https://web.mile.app/route/visit) menu.
*   The user location history is updated, or the [Start Finish feature](https://web.mile.app/setting/permission) is active for that user so the user location history and time are recorded properly.

If those two conditions are fulfilled, new information will be generated for this Ongoing task icon, and you could see this tooltip when you hover over the Ongoing Task icon:

*   **ETA**

_Example from the picture above: ETA 14:25_

This ETA will show you the **estimated arrival time of the user to this task location,** the calculation is based on the Last Update location of the user and the travel time that they need to reach this task location from their latest location history.

*   **Delay Estimate**

_Example from the picture above: (+5 mins)_

This information will **only be displayed if the user is estimated to be late to reach their next task location compared to the ETA** that is generated from the route optimization process.

For example: if the user is expected to be late 5 minutes compared to their ETA time, the tooltip will show the extra information (+5 mins).

But, if the user is expected to reach their next location within the ETA or earlier than the ETA, this extra information won't be displayed.

# Introduction to Route Optimization

![](https://t3837933.p.clickup-attachments.com/t3837933/083b965c-4a5e-45da-8fcf-7cf8610e230a/image.png)
_Routing Result in MileApp_

[**Route Optimization**](https://web.mile.app/route/visit) is MileApp's key feature that lets you plan the most efficient route for your field users.
With this feature, you're equipped with a powerful tool to enhance your field operations. Say goodbye to inefficient routes, unnecessary costs, and wasted time. Start optimizing your routes today and experience the benefits of streamlined and efficient field operations.
Our route optimization engine is based on the [Travelling Salesman Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_salesman_problem) algorithm, where iteration is done to find the minimum distance using the least number of vehicles within the given parameter.
## Available Parameters
The routing parameter is defined as the available configuration for the routing engine to take into consideration to give the best result.
You can use several routing parameters; each parameter can be configured in either a visit vehicle or a routing configuration.
Each parameter is either a hard or soft constraint; hard constraint means the resulting solution will not cross this parameter, while soft constraint means the resulting solution may cross this parameter if it cannot find a feasible solution.

| **Parameter** | **Explanation** | **Configure in** | **Type** |
| ---| ---| ---| --- |
| Time window | This defines the range of time in the day when a visit can be visited | Visit | Hard constraint |
| Visit time | This parameter specifies how long the visit is in minutes | Visit | Hard constraint |
| Tag | This parameter will let visits use vehicles with the same tag | Visit, vehicle | Hard constraint |
| Capacity constraint | This parameter defines what kind of capacity each visit has and the minimum and maximum capacity each vehicle has. | Visit, vehicle | Minimum - soft constraint, maximum - hard constraint |
| Working time | This parameter defines the time in a day when the vehicle can work. | Vehicle | Hard constraint |
| Cost factor | This parameter defines the priority of the vehicle to be used based on its cost factor (0-100), with 0 as the highest priority and 100 as the lowest priority | Vehicle | Hard constraint |
| Auto speed | if set to true, the engine will determine the vehicle speed based on historical data<br>if set to false, the user can determine the speed of each vehicle and the default speed (in km/h) | Vehicle, Routing Configuration | Hard Constraint |
| Return to hub | If set to true, this parameter will provide a solution where the vehicle needs to return to the hub before the working time ends.<br>If set to false, the vehicle must finish the last visit before the working time ends. | Routing configuration | Hard constraint |
| Multi-trip | If set to true, the system will let the vehicle to be able to return to the hub to reset the vehicle capacity; this will let each vehicle have more than one trip in a day. | Routing configuration | Soft constraint |
| Clustering | If set to true, the optimization result will try to minimize the area overlapping between vehicles. | Routing configuration | Soft constraint |
| Use all vehicle | If set to true, the result will try to use all the vehicles available instead of finding the minimum number of vehicle | Routing configuration | Soft constraint |
| Auto split | If set to true, whenever there is a visit with more capacity than the maximum capacity on the matching tags, the system will split the visit into two or more visits so that it can be fitted into one or more trucks. | Routing configuration | Soft constraint |
| Auto merge | if set to true, whenever there is more than one visit with the exact latitude and longitude present, it will considered as one visit so that the solution doesn't place these visits in different vehicles | Routing configuration | Soft constraint |
| Grouped Visit and Priority | Visits assigned to the exact vehicle will be placed accordingly and ordered by priority. A lower number indicates a higher priority. | Visit | Hard constraint |

### **Time Window**
This parameter defines when a visit can and should be visited,
In most cases, time windows are often used to specify the timeframe for a shipment or delivery to arrive or be picked up before it closes. Time windows help ensure logistics operations run smoothly and efficiently by providing clear expectations and reducing uncertainty.
For example, if an outlet opens at 8 AM and closes at 5 PM, the delivery may be scheduled to arrive between these times by setting up the visit open time at 8 AM and visit close time at 5 PM.
This can be set in **routing > visit** menu :
![](https://t3837933.p.clickup-attachments.com/t3837933/f5875fd1-0e82-4b97-8042-5595669b727d/image.png)
This will ensure that the routing result will have the outlets visited by your available vehicle only between these times.
### **Visit time**
This parameter defines the time it takes for a vehicle to wait at each visit before departing to the next destination; it can also be called **unloading time** because, usually, in most cases, it is the time taken to unload goods from the vehicle.
This can be set up in **Routing > Visit** menu :
![](https://t3837933.p.clickup-attachments.com/t3837933/51ca3a93-52e1-4918-90e3-c8b825d52079/image.png)
### **Tag**
The tag parameter indicates which vehicle needs to be used for the visit; the routing system will find the result in which that visit and vehicle have the same tag.
#### Use case: road class
The most common tag use case of the tag parameter is road class, where each visit is tagged depending on what type of vehicle can pass that road to that specific visit.
![](https://t3837933.p.clickup-attachments.com/t3837933/b7e9c5c1-cf5e-4bb5-8c99-21b85fe2aa5f/image.png)
The picture above illustrates that we can classify the visit tag depending on the road size **(small, medium, big)** and that the vehicles are given corresponding tags.
#### Use case: dedicated vehicle
Another common use case of tag parameter is the **dedicated** vehicle case; for example, if you have several vehicles dedicated to collecting cash on delivery, these vehicles can have "**COD"** as a tag, and the visits that require cash collection on delivery can use the same tag.
### **Capacity Constraint**
Capacity is a critical factor in logistics, as it determines the ability of the logistics provider to meet customer demand, fulfill orders, and deliver products on time.
MileApp lets you use up to 10 capacity constraints; some of the commonly used capacity constraints are:
*   Weight
*   Volume
*   Packs
*   Boxes
*   Frozen-weight
*   Chilled-weight
Capacity can be measured in various units, such as weight, volume, or number of items, depending on the nature of the products being transported or stored.
You first need to set capacity constraint configuration along with the unit in the **Routing > Configuration** menu:
![](https://t3837933.p.clickup-attachments.com/t3837933/f5bd0646-e81d-4344-9be0-cbbc5f1ec6ab/image.png)
Once the configuration is set, you will be able to set the maximum and minimum capacity each vehicle can take; while the maximum parameter is a hard constraint, which means the optimization result will not cross this rule, the minimum parameter instead is a soft constraint, where our optimization engine will cross the rule if no feasible result is found
You can set this in **Routing > Vehicle** menu on each vehicle:
![](https://t3837933.p.clickup-attachments.com/t3837933/d2240e91-6f0c-4f25-afbc-2ffcb5499956/image.png)
Each visit will then have its capacity accordingly; if nothing is filled in the visit menu, it equates to 0
You can set this in **Routing > Visit** menu on each visit:
![](https://t3837933.p.clickup-attachments.com/t3837933/92bc765f-0c1e-474d-9cad-64fb09b2c9a9/image.png)

Note: You can create more capacity constraints, but each hub is only allowed to select up to 10 constraints. The list of constraints will be the same across all hubs within your organization, but each hub can use different constraints.

### Working Time
Working time sets up the timeframe a vehicle can go with; this parameter doesn't let any visit be given outside the given timeframe. in the case where the parameter "return to hub" is set to true,
Users can also set the working time to be more than one day in cases where they want to plan for more than a day simultaneously
You can set this in **Routing > Vehicle** on each vehicle:
![](https://t3837933.p.clickup-attachments.com/t3837933/86a9cfd9-3b55-40a6-9fde-5b867db66197/image.png)
### Cost Factor
The cost factor parameter enables you to determine which vehicles are given priority; the cost factor defines the cost multiplier for each vehicle. for example, if vehicle A has the cost factor 1 and vehicle B has the cost factor set to 10, then the cost to deliver using vehicle B is ten times the cost for vehicle B
This parameter is useful when you have your internal vehicle and use an additional vehicle from the vendor; in this case, you can set your internal vehicle to have a cost factor of 0 and the ones from a vendor to be 10. this will let the engine always fill your vehicle first before using the vendor's vehicle
You can set this in **Routing > Vehicle** on each vehicle:
![](https://t3837933.p.clickup-attachments.com/t3837933/20b5115b-06f0-40f5-9a42-37e67770d479/image.png)
### Auto Speed
Auto speed parameter, when turned on, will use the historical vehicle speed in the given area. we also let you fill the speed manually in km/h, in cases where you may want to consider slower or faster moving vehicle
You can set this at **Routing > Configuration**:
![](https://t3837933.p.clickup-attachments.com/t3837933/af1f73e1-4dcc-4903-a09e-9ebc10d76a3f/image.png)

Note: If Auto Speed is enabled, the speed field for each vehicle will be disabled.

### Return to Hub
Return to hub option make sure that each vehicle returns to the hub as the last leg of the trip; the return trip back to the hub will satisfy the condition of working time, which means if a vehicle's working time is 8 AM to 5 PM, it will return to the hub before 5 PM.
![](https://t3837933.p.clickup-attachments.com/t3837933/eb2924da-d353-48b1-87f1-49462251deaa/image.png)
With the latest enhancement, you can now specify whether vehicles should return to the hub **before** or **after** their working hours end. If this option is left unchecked, the vehicle will automatically return to the hub before the end of its working hours. This setting can also impact the routing results, as different routes may be generated depending on your choice.
If this parameter is false, the system will not have to return to the hub as part of the trip, and the trip will end on the last visit.

Note: This option will be automatically activated when the Multi Trip option is turned on.

### Multi Trip
Multi-trip enables a vehicle to return to the hub to reset its capacity constraint and start another trip.
![](https://t3837933.p.clickup-attachments.com/t3837933/7c099349-396b-4089-b0cc-2119bb35a390/image.png)
### Clustering
Clustering will let our engine group nearby visits together, minimizing overlapping between areas served between vehicles.

Without Clustering
![](https://t3837933.p.clickup-attachments.com/t3837933/170cc103-9d9d-448f-8949-835b93f2e753/image.png)
With Clustering
![](https://t3837933.p.clickup-attachments.com/t3837933/abe7615a-3d1f-41dc-947f-97f48eadcab0/image.png)
### Use All Vehicle
All vehicle options will let the optimization engine use all the available vehicles to get a result instead of finding the minimum number of vehicles required; this is useful in cases where you want all your vehicles to have an equal distribution of visits.
### Auto-Split
With Auto Split, the system will automatically split visits with a capacity of more than any single vehicle into several visits to generate results without dropping the large visit. This feature will only evaluate vehicles that have **matching tags** to determine if splitting is [required.Read](http://required.Read) more [here](https://doc.clickup.com/3837933/p/h/3n3zd-81962/aa00834626ae24f/3n3zd-191816) for details.
### Auto-Merge
With Auto Merge, orders with the exact coordinate will be put together in the exact vehicle and back-to-back order; this will prevent orders from the same customer from being put into different vehicles, which can happen in the optimization process. Read more [here](https://doc.clickup.com/3837933/p/h/3n3zd-81962/aa00834626ae24f/3n3zd-231736) for details.
### Visit Group
Similar to the tag system, when activated, visits with the same vehicle parameter will be grouped and assigned to the exact vehicle. Read more [here](https://doc.clickup.com/3837933/p/h/3n3zd-81962/aa00834626ae24f/3n3zd-245116).
## Flow configuration for routing parameter
Before using the routing system, we need to relate the flow component to a routing visit parameter; this can be found in the menu **Flow > Configuration > Route.**

![](https://t3837933.p.clickup-attachments.com/t3837933/562085c1-b042-4b34-bac5-965095077dbe/image.png)

Each visit parameter requires a corresponding input type from the flow; the input type for each parameter is given in the table below.

| **Routing key** | **Type of input component** |
| ---| --- |
| Visit name | Text |
| Address | Address |
| Open time | Time |
| Close time | Time |
| Visit Duration | Number |
| Coordinate | Coordinate |
| Tag | Text |
| Constraint | Number, Currency |

## Feature: Dynamic Routing
Dynamic routing ensures that routed visits remain with the same vehicle even after re-routing. If additional visits are added after optimization, previously routed visits will not be reassigned to different vehicles as they were in the earlier optimization. The package icon will be displayed next to the visit name as shown below:
![](https://t3837933.p.clickup-attachments.com/t3837933/7bf7c9a6-5ec4-4b9e-9c73-e276f99118fa/image.png)

# Visit

![](https://t3837933.p.clickup-attachments.com/t3837933/5b46dc31-0d17-49e9-a743-d1ecfc089b8c/image.png)
A Visit is a term used at MileApp to represent the destination of a field user. Visits can represent various activities, such as a delivery location, a pickup location, a home visit location, and more.
Visits are generated from Routable Tasks that have proper [Flow](https://web.mile.app/flow/flow) configurations. You can add a new Visit from the [Task](https://web.mile.app/tasks/task) menu.

# Visit Page

On the Visit page, you will see a list of active tasks. Active tasks are those with a status of either Ongoing or Unassigned. These tasks are ready for routing optimization, but you can still update some information related to the optimization.
![](https://t3837933.p.clickup-attachments.com/t3837933/509c4f15-33a5-465a-a7f6-0d93825c8b24/image.png)
Here's the detailed breakdown of each section:
1. **Map View**: This map displays all visit coordinates. The numbers indicate the visit order as shown on the left.
2. **Filter**: You can filter visits by typing a name or address. You can also filter by task status or flow name.
3. **Select All**: Use this toggle to select or unselect all visits. Unselected visits will not be included in the routing optimization process.
4. **Total Visit**: This shows the number of selected visits out of the total visits.
5. **Visit Name**: Displays the name of each visit.
6. **Coordinate Validation Indicator**: Ensure the pin icon is green. If it is not, it means our system failed to geocode the coordinates or they are in an incorrect format. To fix this:
    *   Input the coordinates manually using this format: latitude,longitude.
    *   Adjust the address to a more readable format to help our system geocode it successfully.
7. **Expand Visit**: Click the dropdown arrow to view and edit each visit's parameters. See this [section](https://doc.clickup.com/3837933/p/h/3n3zd-81962/aa00834626ae24f/3n3zd-83562) for more detail.
8. **Optimize Button**: Click this button when you are ready for routing optimization. If you do not have any vehicles, the Optimize button will not be shown. In that case, go to the "Vehicle" submenu to set up your vehicles.

# (removed) Optimize Visit

After you set up the Visit and have set up a Vehicle, you could Optimize those Visits to get an Optimized route based on our engine calculation.

# How to Create a Vehicle

In this section, we will guide you on how to create a vehicle from the Vehicle Page.

Required Permission:
*   View Vehicle
*   Create Vehicle

![](https://t3837933.p.clickup-attachments.com/t3837933/e1d6cbaa-f6bb-4b61-b72c-28a0987f703a/image.png)
1. **Click the "New" button** to add a new vehicle.
2. **Load Sample Data**: Use this option to view an example of vehicle data.
3. **Fill in the Necessary Fields** for each vehicle.
When finished, click the Submit button to continue. The newly created vehicle will be active by default.
Below are detailed guidelines for each input:
1. **Name**. Input the vehicle's name, which can include identifiers like a police number (e.g., B 1234 SYZ).
2. **Assignee**. Select the user to be assigned to this vehicle, or leave this empty. You can assign the user later when routing is done.
3. **Working Time**. Specify the vehicle's daily working hours; if not, the default is 08:00 to 17:00. Empty vehicles adopt the working hours of others if specified. For more detail, please see the Working Time section below.
4. **Break Time**. Configure break time for the vehicle within the specified working start and end time. For more detail, please see the Break Time section below.
5. **Speed**. Define the vehicle's speed, ensuring it meets a minimum of 5 km/h. Note: this field will be disabled if you activate "Auto Speed" in the Configuration page.
6. **Cost Factor**. The Cost Factor value ranges from 0 to 100, with the default value set to 0. A lower number indicates a higher priority for routing optimization purposes.
7. **Vehicle Tags**. Use tags to pair visits with vehicles, optimizing routes by matching tags for efficient assignments. Ensure that one or more vehicle tags match the tags of the visit you wish to filter. Please refer to the scenarios below for more understanding:
    1. **Scenario 1**: If a vehicle has 2 tags ("a" and "b") while the visit has 3 tags ("a", "b", and "c"), then this visit will be dropped.
    2. **Scenario 2**: If a vehicle has 3 tags ("a", "b", and "c") while the visit also has 3 tags ("a", "b", and "c"), then this visit will be optimized.
    3. **Scenario 3**: If a vehicle has 4 tags ("a", "b", "c", and "d") while the visit has 3 tags ("a", "b", and "c"), then this visit will be optimized.
8. **Capacity Constraint**. Define the minimum and maximum capacity for each vehicle. The capacity is based on the selected capacity in the Routing/Configuration menu.
* * *
## Working Time
By **default**, the timeframe is set from **08:00** to **17:00**. However, users can adjust this according to their specific requirements. This parameter restricts any visits to occur within the specified timeframe. Empty vehicles, those without explicitly defined working hours, will adopt the working hours of other vehicles if specified.
Additionally, if the parameter "return to hub" is enabled, users have the option to set the working time for more than one day. This feature facilitates planning for extended periods, allowing users to simultaneously plan routes multiple days.
### Working Time Validation
When inputting working hours, ensure that the starting time precedes the ending time. Failure to adhere to this rule will prompt a validation message, guiding you to correct the error before proceeding.
![](https://t3837933.p.clickup-attachments.com/t3837933/8b2bb365-da43-4cf5-b50a-44ab6e12bc54/image.png)
* * *
## Break Time
It's crucial to understand that when configuring breaks for multiday operations, the break schedule remains consistent across all days. For example, if the Working Time spans from 07:00 to 17:00 with an additional day, and the Break Time is set from 12:00 to 13:00, the vehicle will take a break from 12:00 to 13:00 each day.
For a comprehensive understanding of how working time, break time, and multiday settings interact, consider the following scenarios:
*   If the **break start time falls after the end of the working time**, the optimization will **fail**. For example:
    *   Working Time: 19:00 - 05:00 +1 day (7:00 PM - 5:00 AM)
    *   Break Time: 06:00 - 07:00 (6:00 AM - 7:00 AM)
*   If the **break occurs within the working time**, the optimization will **succeed**. For example:
    *   Working Time: 19:00 - 05:00 +1 day (7:00 PM - 5:00 AM)
    *   Break Time: 00:00 - 01:00 (12:00 AM - 1:00 AM)
*   If the **break start time precedes the start of the working time**, the optimization will **fail**. For example:
    *   Working Time: 19:00 - 05:00 +1 day (7:00 PM - 5:00 AM)
    *   Break Time: 18:00 - 19:00 (6:00 PM - 7:00 PM)
### Break Time Validation
Similar to working time validation, ensure that the break start time precedes the break end time to avoid any validation errors.

# Configuration

Configuration involves defining the parameters and inputs that the system will use to calculate the optimal route. By carefully configuring the routing optimization system, you can ensure it is tailored to your specific needs and can produce the best possible results.

Within a configuration, you will find the following settings:
![](https://t3837933.p.clickup-attachments.com/t3837933/2bb3d1db-3f99-4a59-b739-c6342f4b1217/image.png)
1. **Filter Hub**. Each configuration is unique to its hub.
2. **Auto Speed and Default Speed**.
    *   When unchecked, you can define the default speed manually.
    *   If you choose to use auto speed, it will automatically adjust based on historical data.
3. **Default Visit Time**.
    *   Specifies the duration required for a worker to complete a task in one visit if not specified in the visit data.
    *   Additionally, there is a dynamic visit time based on the selected capacity. Read more [here](https://doc.clickup.com/3837933/p/h/3n3zd-81962/aa00834626ae24f/3n3zd-233076).
4. **Other Configuration**. Read more [here](https://doc.clickup.com/3837933/p/h/3n3zd-81962/aa00834626ae24f/3n3zd-82222) for a detailed understanding of each configuration option.
5. **Capacity Constraint**.
    *   Add a new variable that can be used to constrain each optimization.
    *   This constraint will be persistent across all hubs in your organization, but each hub can customize which constraints are checked or used.
6. **Geotagging**. Read more [here](https://doc.clickup.com/3837933/p/h/3n3zd-81962/aa00834626ae24f/3n3zd-236956) for details.
For more details on each parameter, please refer to this [documentation](https://doc.clickup.com/3837933/p/h/3n3zd-81962/aa00834626ae24f/3n3zd-82222).

## Managing Routing Configuration Profiles
Managing routing configuration profiles allows you to customize and optimize routing setups for different needs without repeatedly adjusting settings. You can have multiple profiles for each hub, with no maximum limit. This allows you to set up different configurations for various routing scenarios.
### **Profile Creation and Editing**
Use the "Save as Profile" button to create a new profile. Enter a unique name for the profile when prompted.
![](https://t3837933.p.clickup-attachments.com/t3837933/fde8d6b3-3ee4-44bd-9c48-ba9dafff7018/image.png)
To rename a profile, click the edit icon next to the profile name in the Profile Manager dialog.
![](https://t3837933.p.clickup-attachments.com/t3837933/2c389025-0dc6-44f5-a413-de538cd18043/image.png)
### **Profile Deletion**
Click the delete icon next to the profile name in the Profile Manager dialog. Confirm the deletion in the pop-up dialog. **Note** that you cannot delete the last remaining profile in the hub.
![](https://t3837933.p.clickup-attachments.com/t3837933/9fa74858-0b74-432b-ae51-e91d2bfc4e67/image.png)
### **Profile Selection**
Select from existing profiles using the dropdown. If no profile is created, the "Default Profile" is selected by default.
![](https://t3837933.p.clickup-attachments.com/t3837933/95be14e8-15ea-450c-8596-0fe492a7d2c7/image.png)

Profiles are optional. You can still optimize routing even if no profile is set; in such cases, the Default Profile will be automatically selected.

## Optimize
If you have visits ready and all necessary configurations set, you can start the optimization process by clicking the "Optimize" button located below the vehicle list.![](https://t3837933.p.clickup-attachments.com/t3837933/928433eb-4c7a-47f3-a4a8-c957c6d2e387/image.png)
If no visits are available, the button will display "Input Visit" and redirect you to the Visit page.

* * *
### Other configuration (notes internal only)
1. `visits.sameVehicle` ➝ Visits with same value of 'sameVehicle' will be assigned to same vehicle
2. `visits.prioritySequence` ➝ Visit with lower 'prioritySquence' will be visited earlier than visit with higher 'prioritySequence'
3. `configuration.logisticsos: true` ➝ Hanya untuk organisasi Japfa pada tgl 6 May

![](https://t3837933.p.clickup-attachments.com/t3837933/bb4fab4d-7cc3-420d-99d8-3424b9e9c028/image.png)

4. Note: auto speed tidak bisa diketahui nilainya, karena langsung ambil dari data "distance" dari OSRM, dan dari OSRM juga tidak bisa dikonfirmasi apakah juga mempertimbangkan trafficnya (macet atau tidaknya).

# Clustering Options (internal)

Clustering is a technique that groups nearby visits together to create more efficient routes. By categorizing visits into clusters, the system calculates routes that minimize distance and travel time, ultimately saving your resources.

In this section, we will explore the two visit clustering options available:
![](https://t3837933.p.clickup-attachments.com/t3837933/5afab390-df8a-41ee-82e7-c55645db361f/image.png)
## Normal Clustering
Choose this option if you want the system to decide how to group visits based on where they are. The system will look at which places are close to each other and put them in clusters. This helps make routes better by putting nearby places together.

## Balanced Clustering
If you want things to be more fair and even, this option is for you. With balanced clustering, the system makes sure that visits are divided equally among clusters before deciding how to group them based on location. This is great when you want every vehicle to have a similar amount of work and still have optimized routes.

## To access the visit clustering configuration options:

1. Navigate to the Routing/Configuration menu.
2. Click the checkbox labeled "Clustering."
3. Choose either "Clustering Normal" or "Clustering Balanced" based on your preferences.

## Example Clustering Illustrations

For a visual understanding, refer to the example illustrations below:

**Normal Clustering**

![](https://t3837933.p.clickup-attachments.com/t3837933/045d15f0-16a7-4865-a330-259d67dbd20a/image.png)

**Balanced Clustering**
As you can observe, by utilizing the same visits and vehicles from the previous routing, the balanced clustering guarantees that all vehicles receive their respective visits.

![](https://t3837933.p.clickup-attachments.com/t3837933/bb13e06a-c94d-45bd-9471-faae60a26ac7/image.png)

# Cross Docking

This feature enhances your routing capabilities through **Sub Hubs**. This manual will guide you through the setup and usage of the Cross Docking feature.

![](https://t3837933.p.clickup-attachments.com/t3837933/2cf26133-c7f1-40e0-815f-bcc087afa124/image.png)

## Activating Cross Docking
To activate Cross Docking, follow these steps:
1. Go to the Routing/Configuration menu.
2. Check the "Cross Docking" checkbox.
3. Two Cross Docking types will be available:
    *   **Route all visits to sub hub:** Routes all visits through Sub Hubs before reaching the destination.
    *   **Route dropped visits only:** Routes unrouted visits to Sub Hubs, while direct delivery from the Main Hub is still possible.
4. The "Maximum Distance" option for vehicle sub hubs allows you to specify the maximum distance, in meters, that a vehicle can travel. If you don't want to set a maximum distance, leave this field empty.
    1. **Rules and Validation**:
        1. Rule: It's important to note that the maximum distance setting only affects vehicles stationed at sub-hubs. Vehicles originating from the main hub remain unaffected by this parameter.
        2. Validation:
            1. Upon initially checking the Maximum Distance checkbox, the input field defaults to an empty state, prompting you to enter a value.
            2. The minimum allowable value for Maximum Distance is set at **1000 meters**.

![](https://t3837933.p.clickup-attachments.com/t3837933/7602db03-c08e-4254-a31d-c5c8c84a3822/image.png)
_Cross Docking option_
## Sub Hub Management
After activating the Cross Docking option, a feature to manage the Sub Hub will be available below. On this page, you can create, edit, and delete the Sub Hub, but you need to map the vehicles on the Routing/Vehicle page. Follow these steps:
### Creating Sub Hubs
1. Click the "Add sub hub" button to choose a hub.
2. Choose and configure up to 10 Sub Hubs

Only hubs within the same country as the active hub can be set as sub hubs.

### Mapping Vehicles to Sub Hubs
1. In the Routing/Vehicle menu, create or edit vehicle data.
2. In the top corner, you can choose to manage vehicle for main hub or sub hubs.
3. You can specify whether a vehicle is allowed to be routed to sub-hubs by selecting the option "**Allow this vehicle to be routed to a sub-hub**" Note that this option only applies when choosing the "Route dropped visits only" type of Cross Docking.

![](https://t3837933.p.clickup-attachments.com/t3837933/e23a0874-29a9-404c-a86c-7841ea1c2115/image.png)

After successfully creating vehicle for the corresponding Main Hub and Sub Hub, a clear indicator the Sub Hub to which a vehicle belongs will appear on vehicle list.

![](https://t3837933.p.clickup-attachments.com/t3837933/5b59c7a5-aa01-4186-8b9d-1ac8d86c023d/image.png)
## Route Optimization

## Dispatching Visits
When clicking "Dispatch," the process of assignment will run in the background as we generate **additional tasks** from the Main Hub to Sub Hubs to facilitate order **handovers**. The number of tasks generated will depend on the count of routed visits to Sub Hubs. The additional tasks will include some relevant information such as "Handover From" (taken from the assignee vehicle), "Handover To" (user input), and "List Order" (task title).
When dispatching routing results with Cross Docking, remember:
*   Tasks routed to Sub Hubs will be moved accordingly.
*   In the Task menu, select the corresponding sub-hub in the right corner to view assignments.

# Auto Split

With Auto Split, the system will automatically split visits with a capacity of more than any single vehicle into several visits to generate results without dropping the large visit. This feature will only evaluate vehicles that have **matching tags** to determine if splitting is required.
## Activate the Auto Split
To activate Auto Split, follow these steps:
1. Go to the Routing/Configuration menu.
2. Check the "Auto Split" checkbox.
3. Two split types will be available:
    *   Split capacity equally
    *   Maximize vehicle capacity. Note: Only the first defined capacity will be considered in the routing optimization process.

_The second segment of the visit "Sven Arvidsson" in vehicle 2_
The routing result for the visit "Sven Arvidsson" has been split into two visits equally, with each visit having a capacity of 1750 out of the total 3500.

**Example using "Maximize vehicle capacity" type**:
![](https://t3837933.p.clickup-attachments.com/t3837933/1a65a638-0965-4d03-97f6-a5a88a4ffcd6/image.png)

_The second segment of the visit "Sven Arvidsson" in vehicle 2_
As depicted, the first segment will utilize the maximum capacity of the vehicle, 3000, while the remaining capacity, 500, will be allocated to the second segment.
## Exporting Data
When exporting data, the "Other" sheet will include information about the Auto Split type.
![](https://t3837933.p.clickup-attachments.com/t3837933/3705c597-9e51-48f0-9de5-f66f72cefc70/image.png)
## Dispatching Visits
Upon clicking "Dispatch," the system initiates background processing to assign tasks based on routing results. If a visit is split into multiple segments, a new task is generated for each segment, maintaining data integrity and ensuring accurate capacity allocation. The original task's capacity is updated accordingly to reflect the split.

**Important Note**:
1. It is **recommended** to configure the capacity constraint field with the component in the task from the Flow menu. Failure to do so may result in an empty capacity constraint in the Routing/Visit menu, which can be manually inputted later.

![](https://t3837933.p.clickup-attachments.com/t3837933/91725a1d-6b74-409a-9718-9bb41b3a9c02/image.png)

_Route Configuration in Flow/Configuration menu_

2. Upon dispatching, the detailed task will display information regarding the split type and split number. However, if the split visit is on the dropped list, it will retain the original task and remain "Unassigned."

![](https://t3837933.p.clickup-attachments.com/t3837933/d44374a6-e4d9-480f-a9e9-c46eb3b545de/image.png)

3. If you exceed your task quota, failed dispatches may occur, as a new task is generated based on the split number during dispatching.
4. When Auto Split is used in conjunction with the Auto Merge feature, identical coordinate visits will not be split across different vehicles.

# Auto Merge

With Auto Merge, orders with the exact coordinate will be put together in the exact vehicle and back-to-back order; this will prevent orders from the same customer from being put into different vehicles, which can happen in the optimization process.
## Activate the Auto Merge**:**
To activate Auto Merge, follow these steps:
1. Go to the Routing/Configuration menu.
2. Check the "Auto Merge" checkbox.

With Auto Merge activated, visits with identical coordinates will no longer be assigned to different vehicles, ensuring optimal resource utilization.

It's important to note that the Auto Merge feature does not physically merge visits together. Instead, it ensures that visits with identical coordinates are not assigned to different vehicles.

When utilizing the Auto Merge feature in conjunction with Auto Split, visits with identical coordinates will not be split across multiple vehicles. This ensures that the integrity of the merged visits is maintained.

# Visit Group

The Visit Group feature is designed to help you specify the sequence of visits in a specific order, such as ensuring pickups are completed before deliveries. Additionally, all visits within the same group are assigned to the **same vehicle**.
### Defining Visit Groups
You will find two new inputs: **Visit Group** and **Priority**:
![](https://t3837933.p.clickup-attachments.com/t3837933/446d3820-2d01-4e88-aad6-881265dfabec/image.png)
1. **Visit Group**: This field allows you to assign visits to specific groups and ensure the same group is assigned to the same vehicle. Leave it empty if you want the routing to ignore visit grouping.
2. **Priority**: Specify the priority of visits within a group. The default priority is set to 0, with a range from 0 to 100. **A lower number indicates a higher priority**.
In the **Routing/Result** menu, visit group information is displayed similarly to visit tags but highlighted in red and positioned below the visit tags.

When exporting routing results to Excel, the Visit Group feature includes additional information:
*   **Per Vehicle Sheet**: New columns "Visit Group" and "Visit Priority" are included.

Note:
*   **Support for Multiple Visits**: The Visit Group feature supports not only two visits but also multiple visits.
*   **Sequential Execution**: While Visit Group Priority ensures visits are executed in the specified order within a group, it does not guarantee sequential execution. Other visits might be interleaved between sequential visits.
*   If you need to save the visit group in the task data, you must map it first in **Flow > Configuration > Route**. This ensures that when the dispatch routing result is sent, the visit group and priority are also included in the task data.

# Dynamic Visit Time

This feature enables you to customize visit times according to capacity constraints. By default, visit times are provided per visit in the Routing/Visit menu. However, if you prefer dynamic visit times based on capacity constraints, you can utilize this feature.
## Configure The Dynamic Visit Time
1. Navigate to **Routing/Configuration** menu
2. Look for the Default Visit Time input field.
3. Adjacent to this field, you will find the **Dynamic Visit Time** icon.

![](https://t3837933.p.clickup-attachments.com/t3837933/734ed5ef-8273-4803-a245-37aab5c607b9/image.png)

4. Hover over the icon to view tooltip text for **guidance**.
5. **Click** on the Dynamic Visit Time icon to initiate configuration.
6. A **pop-up window** will appear, displaying checked capacity constraints.

![](https://t3837933.p.clickup-attachments.com/t3837933/8a411c7d-4102-4ca9-897e-d8a740651eca/image.png)

7. **Define the visit time for each capacity constraint** according to your requirements.
8. If you do not wish to utilize a specific capacity constraint for routing optimization, you can either set its visit time to zero (**0**).
9. Once you have configured the dynamic visit times for capacity constraints, click the "**Submit**" button to save your changes.

*   If the per-visit visit time is unspecified, it will be calculated as the sum of the default visit time and dynamic visit time.
*   If both per-visit visit time and default visit time are specified, priority is given to the per-visit visit time.

# Geotagging

This configuration allows you to automatically assign visit tags based on geographic areas.
## How to Create a Geotag
1. **Navigate to the Routing/Configuration menu and scroll down to the Geotagging section.**
2. **Click on the + icon** to start creating a new tag.

![](https://t3837933.p.clickup-attachments.com/t3837933/7b537213-2335-4c64-81a5-d210d0383aaa/image.png)

3. **Enter the tag name**, for example, "Selatan". This name usually corresponds to a specific area. Note: The geotag name must be **unique** and cannot be duplicated.
4. **Click on the map icon** to start creating a polygon by dropping points on the map to outline the area.
5. **Click Submit** when you have finished defining the area.

![](https://t3837933.p.clickup-attachments.com/t3837933/d182508a-6476-4659-8821-676d86278fb7/image.png)

*   The list of geotags is specific to each **hub**. Whenever you change the filter hub in the top right corner, the geotag list will update accordingly.
*   If a visit already has a manually input tag, the geotag will be added to the existing visit tag.
*   When polygons overlap, a visit within the overlapping area will be tagged with all relevant geotags.

## Example
Once geotagging is set up, any visit within the defined area will automatically receive the corresponding tag. For instance, if you create a geotag named "Selatan" for the area below:
![](https://t3837933.p.clickup-attachments.com/t3837933/ed2bb50d-3f86-49a8-8285-fcaad513733d/image.png)
Any visit occurring at coordinates within this area will automatically be tagged as "Selatan" when you optimize routing.
![](https://t3837933.p.clickup-attachments.com/t3837933/e06a736e-2820-4d0f-863d-d708bd189362/image.png)

**Notes**: Before optimizing, you can select specific geotags to include in the route optimization.
![](https://t3837933.p.clickup-attachments.com/t3837933/dc78153c-6857-4ebb-bb7a-e988051baedc/image.png)
## How to Edit Geotag
If you need to modify the area of a saved geotag, follow these steps:
1. Click on the map icon associated with the specific geotag you wish to edit.
![](https://t3837933.p.clickup-attachments.com/t3837933/f0320a0a-d11f-48ae-bcc4-bf8baa571fb6/image.png)
1. A map will appear, displaying the current geotagged area. You can adjust this area in two ways:
    *   **Delete a Point:** Click on a point to remove it from the geotagged area.
    *   **Adjust a Point:** Drag a point to a new location to reshape the geotagged area.
By using these methods, you can easily update the geotag to accurately reflect the desired area.
When you have more than one geotag and you click to edit an area, other geotags will be visible and identifiable by their names:
![](https://t3837933.p.clickup-attachments.com/t3837933/4024bb6a-7a96-48f8-8093-c3f960149424/image.png)

# Avoid Toll Roads

The **Avoid Toll Roads** setting allows you to exclude toll roads from the route optimization process.
When this setting is enabled, the system will calculate and recommend the most efficient route **without using toll roads**, helping you plan routes that fit your operational preferences or cost-saving needs.

Required Permission :
*   View configuration
*   Create configuration
*   Edit configuration

### **How to Activate Avoid Toll Roads**
1. Go to the **Routing → Configuration** menu.
2. Check the **“Avoid Toll Roads”** option.
Once activated, the route optimization will automatically exclude toll roads when generating routes.

You can disable this option anytime if you want the system to include toll roads again in future optimizations.

**Note**:
When you click "Restore" on the current version, it will not add another entry to the history, and the result will remain unchanged. Restoration only reverts the routing to a specific previous change. For example, if you have two history entries:
1. "2 visits moved to vehicle B by Owner" (this is the current version)
2. "Visit Place A moved to vehicle A by Owner"
If you click "Restore" on the second entry, it will cancel the latest change, meaning the visit "Place A" will be moved back to "vehicle A", reverting to the state of the routing at that specific change.
#### Reset Routing Result
If you need to revert your changes to the original state, simply click the "Reset" button. This will undo all modifications, and the reverted record will appear in the history results.
![](https://t3837933.p.clickup-attachments.com/t3837933/63613bd8-adfd-4f40-8313-ca5c576efae7/image.png)

### Vehicle
*   **Vehicle Optimized**: Displays the percentage of assigned vehicles versus unused vehicles. For example, `15/15 (100%)` means that all 15 vehicles have been assigned visits, resulting in 100% utilization.
*   **Visit Optimized**: Displays the percentage of routed visits versus unrouted visits. For example, `43/43 (100%)` means that all 43 visits have been routed into the vehicles, resulting in 100% optimization.
*   **Total Distance**: Displays the total distance covered by all assigned vehicles in kilometers. For example, `234 km`.
*   **Average Speed**: Displays the average speed of all assigned vehicles. If "Auto Speed" is selected in the configuration, it will show "auto".
### Time
*   **Total Travel Time**: Displays the total duration of all assigned vehicles. For example, `9h 51min` means the total travel time for all vehicles is 9 hours and 51 minutes.
*   **Total Visit Time**: Displays the total duration of all assigned vehicles when they arrive at visit locations, such as during handovers or unloading. For example, `36h 48min` means the total visit time for all vehicles is 36 hours and 48 minutes.
*   **Total Waiting Time**: Displays the total duration of all assigned vehicles before they can process tasks, such as when waiting for a store to open. The waiting time is related to the "Open Time" data per visit.
*   **Total Spent Time**: The sum of total travel time, total visit time, and total waiting time.
*   **Range of Finish Time**: The earliest to the latest finish time of all assigned vehicles. For example, `7:32 - 16:42` means the earliest finish time is 7:32 and the latest finish time is 16:42.
*   **Average Finish Time**: The average finish time of all assigned vehicles. For example, `10:05` means the average finish time is 10:05.
### Capacity
The capacity field is dynamic based on the configuration used. For example, `Total Weight 2,000 / 2,300 kg (86%)` means a total of 2,000 kg is optimized out of a maximum total of 2,300 kg across all vehicles, resulting in 86% optimization.
### Others
This section shows the configuration settings used. For example, if the "Return to Hub" option is activated, there will be a checklist icon; otherwise, it will show an X icon. Additionally, it displays the source of the routing optimization and the creation details, such as:
*   **Created from**: WEB
*   **Created Date**: 22 July 2024

# Vehicle Assignment

This section provides detailed information about the vehicle assignment within the optimization result.
![](https://t3837933.p.clickup-attachments.com/t3837933/e00791ef-f01b-4d25-94c1-6142d6f537cb/image.png)

1. **Active Vehicle**. Displays the vehicle currently in use for the optimization. The box on the left side is uniquely colored for each vehicle, corresponding to the route color on the map view.
2. **Visit**. Shows the total number of visits assigned to each vehicle.
3. **Assignee**. Indicates the user assigned to the vehicle, typically the field user name. The available users in this list depend on the location of the route optimization, as it is based on the hub.
4. **Switch Vehicle.** Allows you to transfer all visits from one vehicle to another. Refer to the next section for more detail.
5. **Dropped.** Lists the visits that were not routed.
## Switch Vehicle
If you need to transfer all visits from one vehicle to another, you can use the "Switch Vehicle" feature. Ensure both vehicles have sufficient capacity for the transferred visits.
![](https://t3837933.p.clickup-attachments.com/t3837933/f6a02a40-92ca-4a13-885b-8d6f4b6308e3/image.png)

Important Note:
The switch will not validate the vehicle's working time or the vehicle's tag.

# Dropped Visit

The Dropped Visit displays visits that cannot be routed due to certain constraints or issues. Below are the potential reasons why a visit might appear on the Dropped List and guidance on how to address these issues:
![](https://t3837933.p.clickup-attachments.com/t3837933/86815eb6-eaf8-4630-a68c-970d7b8b0b96/image.png)
The reasons why a visit cannot be routed:
*   The visit's coordinates are outside valid ranges or incorrectly formatted. Verify that the latitude is between -90 and 90, and the longitude is between -180 and 180. Correct any errors in the coordinate values.
*   The visit's capacity requirement surpasses the maximum capacity of all available vehicles. Review the capacity constraints set for the visit and the vehicles. Ensure that there is a vehicle with sufficient capacity to accommodate the visit.
*   The visit's time window does not align with the working hours of any available vehicles. Check the open and close times for the visit and the working hours for the vehicles. Adjust the visit's time window or the vehicle's working hours to find a match.
*   The visit requires specific tags that none of the vehicles have. Ensure that the tags required for the visit are correctly assigned to at least one vehicle. Update either the visit's requirements or the vehicle's tags as needed.
#### Next Steps
After correcting the data issues, you can try rerouting the visit. Alternatively, you can manually move the visit from the Dropped list to a suitable vehicle.
#### Best Practices for Avoiding Dropped Visits
1. Validate Coordinates: Ensure all visit locations are accurately geocoded and validated for correctness.
2. Optimize Capacity Utilization: Balance visit requirements with vehicle capacities to avoid overloading.
3. Synchronize Time Windows: Align visit schedules with vehicle availability to ensure feasible routing.
4. Tag Management: Maintain consistent and accurate tagging of both visits and vehicles to ensure compatibility.

If you pick Assign Task automation type (1), you have to choose the Hub & assign a Field user (2), if triggered, the Automation will be assigned a Task to that assigned user in that selected Hub.

In the example above, the Field user that was assigned is "mileapp", and the Field user's Task will be placed in the "Hub 1". So, a new Task that fit this Automation setting will be automatically assigned to "mileapp" in the "Hub 1".

# Move Task

![](https://t3837933.p.clickup-attachments.com/t3837933/bd23a5b1-9083-4e9f-8dd2-c4c376a370c8/3.png)
If you pick Move Task (1) automation type, you have to choose the Hub (2) destination, the Task will be moved to the Hub that is chosen if this type of Automation is triggered.

In the example above, the chosen Hub is "Hub 1", so when the Automation is triggered the Task will automatically move to "Hub 1" regardless of on which Hub it was created.

# Create Task

If you choose the Automation Type "Create Task," you will need to fill in all relevant information about what the new task should look like, including task name, address, coordinate, etc. The fields is depending on the component setting of each flow.
![](https://t3837933.p.clickup-attachments.com/t3837933/79af8eae-529d-4aa1-a1b7-96f9f9a05e85/image.png)
_Choosing Referred Field for Customer Name_
When configuring the details of a new task, you can fill in the components with text, refer to a component from the rule's flow, or leave it empty if the field is optional (required fields will be marked). **Example:** For the "Customer Name" field, you can choose from the available components based on their type. Components that are not of type Bill or List will be available.

![](https://t3837933.p.clickup-attachments.com/t3837933/ac0ae26d-8ae3-4e6c-bd88-ec7c96d64c00/image.png)

**Note:** When mapping a **Bill** or **List** type component, only components of the same type will appear. This ensures consistency in component mapping.

# Create or Update Data Source

The "Automation Type: Update Data Source" feature functions to ease the process of automatically updating data sources once tasks are completed.

![](https://t3837933.p.clickup-attachments.com/t3837933/002e8edb-706d-4c6b-a8fd-c0d2ca41f6b4/image.png)

8. Finally, click the submit button to create the automation.

Tip: If you want to use the "Update Data Source" automation type, make sure you have created a data source and mapped it into the flow configuration. Learn more details here: [Data Source](https://doc.clickup.com/3837933/p/h/3n3zd-95902/1acc0fd538a5a2f)

# Create and Assign Task

The "Automation Type: Create and Assign Task" feature is designed to streamline the process of automatically creating and assigning a new task to a specified assignee.

![](https://t3837933.p.clickup-attachments.com/t3837933/77b68b61-9379-4e6c-a889-c1dcf72dd5a2/image.png)

The process of creating this type of automation is akin to other types. Begin by providing a name for the automation and defining the necessary rules. When selecting "Create and Assign Task" as the Automation Type, pay attention to the details in the Automation setup:
1. **Create Task**. Choose the workflow for the task to be automatically created.
2. **Hub**. Select the hub to which the task belongs.
3. **Initial Page**. Fill in the initial page details for the task.
4. After completing the Initial Page, you will encounter the "**Auto Assignment**" switch. This powerful feature allows you to automate task assignments based on various criteria, such as 'done by,' 'assigned by,' or 'assigned' users.
5. **Assignee**. This step determines who will be responsible for completing the task.

The options in the Assignee dropdown depend on the 'Auto Assignment' toggle. If you don't activate the 'Auto Assignment' toggle, you can manually designate an Assignee according to the user you want to assign. If you activate it, you can assign tasks based on 'done by,' 'assigned by,' or 'assigned' users. This step determines who will be responsible for completing the task.

# Start Trip - End Trip Feature

> The **Start - Finish** feature now has changed its name to **Start Trip - End Trip** Feature**.**

The **Start Trip - End Trip** feature enables MileApp Field users to log their coordinates at set intervals and defines a radius around the hub where they can start and end trips. This feature helps manage task access and location tracking, ensuring users are within designated boundaries.

To enable this feature, go to [**Settings➝Permission➝Advanced**](https://web.mile.app/setting/permission) on MileApp Web.

![](https://t3837933.p.clickup-attachments.com/t3837933/ad46a9c1-2213-428d-8b42-40720e4c44b7/image.png)

By default, the **Start Trip - End Trip** feature is deactivated. To use it, activate the toggle.

### If "Start Trip - End Trip" permission is on
When the Start Trip - End Trip permission is enabled, the **user’s location on the MileApp Field is tracked only if the Start Trip - End Trip feature is active**. The coordinate history will be available on the [Tracking Page.](https://web.mile.app/tasks/tracking)

This feature also ensures that MileApp Field users start their trip within a specified radius around the hub to access their tasks, and their location is tracked once they start the trip. The same applies to finish the trip, where users are restricted to finish the trip only within the designated radius around the hub.

If **Start Trip - End Trip** is active, there are three tracking modes available, each with different intervals and distances between recorded points:
1. **Power Saving** (Saves battery life): Updates location every 10 minutes, with a minimum distance of 10 meters between points.
2. **Balance** (Optimizes accuracy and battery usage): Updates location every 3 minutes, with a minimum distance of 20 meters between points.
3. **High Accuracy** (Consumes battery quickly): Updates location every 1 minute, with a minimum distance of 10 meters between points.

![](https://t3837933.p.clickup-attachments.com/t3837933/780c78ba-88c6-41df-b7f2-d6d896d90f65/image.png)

### If "Start Trip - End Trip" permission is off
When the Start Trip - End Trip permission is **disabled**, only task coordinates are recorded, and the user’s location on the MileApp Field **is not tracked**. Users can access tasks on the MileApp Field without starting a trip.

## Configuring the Feature
You could find the Start Finish feature at the [Permission Page](https://web.mile.app/setting/permission) of the MileApp web, the location is under the "Advanced" setting on the Permission.

This is where you set up the "Start Trip - End Trip" feature:
1. **Toggle** to enable or disable.
2. **Coordinate recording interval**: Set how frequently the app logs the user’s coordinates (e.g., every 5 minutes).
3. **Start Radius**: Defines the maximum distance from the hub to start the trip.
4. **Finish Radius**: Defines the maximum distance from the hub to end the trip and stop the coordinate recording.

![](https://t3837933.p.clickup-attachments.com/t3837933/07d250db-d8d5-4a06-b007-c0d9b1d9cffd/image.png)

### Usage Examples
*   **Setting Coordinate Recording Interval**: If set to 5 minutes, the app logs coordinates every 5 minutes during the trip.
*   **Setting Start and Finish Radius**:
    *   If the **Start Radius** is 500 meters, users can start tasks if they initiate the trip within 500 meters of the hub.
    *   Similarly, with a **Finish Radius** of 500 meters, users can end the trip only if within 500 meters of the hub.
*   If both radii are set to **0 meters**, users can start and end the trip from any location, allowing unrestricted access and tracking.

This feature ensures that users who missed their initial invitation can quickly receive it again. By resending invitations, you can ensure all intended users can access the system and its features.

![](https://t3837933.p.clickup-attachments.com/t3837933/b6b8c319-f8cc-4bd2-b5d7-cdcd49147df9/image.png)
_"Re-send Invitation" button_

## Editing User Information
The Setting-User menu lets you edit user information, specifically the user's name. If a user's name changes or updates, you can easily modify it within the system. This ensures that the displayed name accurately reflects the user's information and facilitates effective communication and identification.

Required Permission:
*   View User
*   Edit User
*   View Role

![](https://t3837933.p.clickup-attachments.com/t3837933/8384fd17-c424-4f93-943e-5e46a4e9a803/image.png)
_Modifying the user's name_

Modifying the user's name can also impact their profile.

![](https://t3837933.p.clickup-attachments.com/t3837933/8d1fb759-d281-4bc4-9e0d-4fdaf39f18e0/image.png)

![](https://t3837933.p.clickup-attachments.com/t3837933/03518215-083c-49eb-81c2-603aa38375d0/image.png)
## Managing Hub Access
A critical aspect of user management is controlling and regulating access to different hubs within the system. A hub is a centralized location for organizing and accessing specific information, data, or resources. The Managing Hub Access feature in the Setting-User menu allows you to determine which hubs a user has permission to access.

The hub access granted to a user directly impacts the filter hub functionality located in the right corner of every page. This filter lets users narrow the displayed information based on a specific hub. However, if users cannot access a particular hub, they cannot filter by that hub.

![](https://t3837933.p.clickup-attachments.com/t3837933/671377f2-8dce-4ba6-942a-3ca229b2e17d/image.png)
_Hub selection for a specific user_

For example, let's say there are three hubs in the system: Hub A, Hub B, and Hub C. If User X has been granted access to Hub A and Hub B but not Hub C, they will only be able to filter information based on Hub A and Hub B. The filter hub feature will not display Hub C as an option for User X since they cannot access it.

![](https://t3837933.p.clickup-attachments.com/t3837933/611762e5-395f-46a6-838e-9707bed5e03e/image.png)
_The hub filter is located in the top right corner of the Task page._

By controlling hub access for each user, you can ensure they only see and interact with the hubs relevant to their role and responsibilities within the system. This helps maintain data integrity, security, and a streamlined user experience.

As an administrator or user with appropriate privileges, you can modify a user's hub access by editing their profile within the Setting-User menu. By granting or revoking hub access for specific users, you can effectively manage their ability to filter and access information related to different hubs.

## Managing Teams
The Team feature is designed to help you efficiently organize your organization by creating and managing teams. Teams are pivotal in streamlining task assignments, improving collaboration, and enhancing organizational efficiency.

![](https://t3837933.p.clickup-attachments.com/t3837933/56d11f56-9e73-47d9-966f-18809f06ae20/image.png)
_Team selection for a specific user_

Please refer to our updated documentation for detailed instructions on using this feature.
## Editing User Roles
Within the Setting-User menu, you can edit the roles assigned to each user. A role defines a user's set of permissions and privileges within the system. By modifying a user's role, you can adjust their level of access, responsibilities, and available functionalities within the system. This feature ensures users have appropriate privileges based on their roles and responsibilities.

![](https://t3837933.p.clickup-attachments.com/t3837933/ccdfe5e2-12d6-46c9-a5b0-9d6aa7e50073/image.png)

1. **Set up Access Permission per Role**
The Setting-Permission menu allows you to set up access permissions for each predefined default role and any custom roles you create. Access permissions define the actions and functionalities that each role can perform within the system. By configuring access permissions, you can control and restrict specific features and data based on role requirements. This feature ensures that users have appropriate access and privileges according to their responsibilities.

If the role is not granted access to a permission, the system will display this alert message, and you can contact your administrator to request access.

## Roles Overview
Upon successful registration and organization verification, your organization will be equipped with four distinct roles:
1. **Owner**: The Owner role holds absolute authority within the system. Owners have unrestricted access to all permissions and functionalities. This role cannot be switched off and is typically reserved for system administrators or high-level decision-makers. Unlike other roles, the Owner role cannot be switched off, renamed, or deleted.
2. **Admin**: The Admin role is responsible for managing the administration of the system. Similar to the Owner role, Admins have comprehensive access to permissions and functionalities. In other organizations, the Admin role can be assigned as the Field User Manager, responsible for overseeing field users' activities and optimizing their workflows.
3. **Planner**: The Planner role is designed for users responsible for managing tasks and routes for field users.
4. **Field User**: The Field User role represents users who perform tasks and operations in the field. This role is typically assigned to individuals such as drivers, sales representatives, or service technicians who execute tasks outside the office. Field Users have specific access permissions relevant to their responsibilities.
### Role Restrictions and Permissions
**Owner Role:**
*   The "Owner" of the organization cannot be deleted or have their role changed, due to billing-related constraints.
**Exclusive Permissions for Owners:**
*   Only the "Owner" can:
    *   Invite another user as an "Owner".
    *   Change another user to "Owner".
    *   Delete another "Owner".
**Restrictions for Non-Owner Roles:**
*   Non-"Owner" roles are not permitted to:
    *   Invite users to the "Owner" role.
    *   Change their own role or the roles of other users to "Owner".
    *   Modify "Owner" information, such as Name, Phone Number, Hub, and Team.
    *   Delete an "Owner".

# Setting Up MFA
**Action Required**: Administrators can configure MFA settings for specific roles through the "Setting/Permission" menu. Follow these steps to set up MFA for your account:

1. Log in to your account using your existing credentials.
2. Navigate to the "Setting/Permission" menu.
3. Select the roles for which you want to enable MFA. You can choose to enable MFA for specific roles or all roles.
4. Save your changes.
Once MFA is enabled for your role, you will be prompted to set up your email address for OTP delivery.

_Assignment in Task Menu_

### Team Rules in User Assignment:

1. **Users Without Teams**: If a user doesn't belong to any team, it means that the user is NOT RESTRICTED in task assignments.
    *   They have the ability to view and be viewed by all users within the organization.
    *   Tasks can be assigned to users without teams by any user,
2. **Users With Teams**: If a logged-in user has a team, they can view users who do not have teams and users who belong to the same team as them.
3. **Selecting Team Members**:
    *   Users are unable to select or assign tasks to users who are not members of the same team.
    *   This ensures that tasks are assigned exclusively to relevant team members, enhancing task management efficiency.
4. **Creating New Teams**: When a user creates a new team, for example, Team A and Team B, they are automatically set as members of Team A and Team B. This streamlines the team creation process and avoids duplication of efforts.
5. **Automatic Owner Access**:
    *   Owners of the organization are automatically granted access to all newly created teams.
    *   This grants owners visibility and control over all aspects of the organization.
    *   Owners maintain the ability to view all users and tasks within the organization, enabling effective monitoring and management.
    *   These rules are consistent for all owners in the organization, regardless of who initially registered the organization.
    *   Newly invited owners immediately receive access to all teams, enabling their contribution to organizational management.

If you don't see this Team menu, please activate the necessary **permissions** by navigating to "Setting/Permission" and heading to the "Setting" category.

After a transaction, your private information (credit cards, social security numbers, financials, etc.) is never kept on file. We cannot, however, ensure or warrant the absolute security of any information you transmit to MileApp or guarantee that your information on the Service may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by a breach of any of our physical, technical, or managerial safeguards.

## Is the information collected through the MileApp Service secure?
We take precautions to protect the security of your information.

Default storage location for new MileApp users is milesto. Users can request where their uploaded files are stored, either on Aws s3 public or milesto private. File storage configuration can only be set by internal MileApp user. If there is a request to change the file upload storage location, follow these steps:
1. Backend (BE) will update the configuration on the API \[Post\] {{URL}}/api/v3/organization/{organizationId}.
    1. **Storage location for Aws s3 and public configuration**:

```plain
{
    "configuration":{
        "filesAccessPermission":"public",
        "filesServerProvider":"awss3"
    }
}
```

1.     1. **Storage location for milesto and private configuration**:

```plain
{
    "configuration":{
        "filesAccessPermission":"private",
        "filesServerProvider":"milesto"
    }
}
```

1. BE informs the product team that the settings update has been made.
2. The product team makes a POST request to the API [https://apiweb.mile.app/api/v3/version](https://apiweb.mile.app/api/v3/version).
    1. Input the organization ID that has changed its storage configuration in the organizationId key.
    2. Input the versionData with the formula (versionNumber)+001 in the versionData key.
    3. The value in the versionData key will always increase by 1 if there is a change in the file storage configuration.
    4. Values in other keys except organizationId and versionData must match the values in the \[Get\] API [https://apiweb.mile.app/api/v3/version/Web-mileapp/last](https://apiweb.mile.app/api/v3/version/Web-mileapp/last).
    5. Example post body:

```plain
{
   "organizationId": "65cace8da1c0d75d9368c8b3",
   "platform": "Web-mileapp",
   "versionName": "v.3.109",
   "versionNumber" : "129",
   "versionData": "129001",
   "releaseTime": "2024-02-13 09:00:00",
   "categoryUpdate": "flexible",
   "changeLog": "Enhanced User Assignment Form Appearance;Improved Workflow for Automation Settings;Enhanced Coordinate Field in Data Type Menu",
   "docUrl": "https://doc.clickup.com/3837933/p/h/3n3zd-96542/e197dd0adc56139/3n3zd-189336",
   "tags": [
           "web",
           "minor update",
           "feature improvement"
   ]
}
```

**Notes**: When posting release notes in the next post without inputting the versionNumber, the value of versionNumber will increase automatically, and versionData will increase as well, but the last 3 digits will become 000.
