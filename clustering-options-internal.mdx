Clustering is a technique that groups nearby visits together to create more efficient routes. By categorizing visits into clusters, the system calculates routes that minimize distance and travel time, ultimately saving your resources.

In this section, we will explore the two visit clustering options available:

## Normal Clustering
Choose this option if you want the system to decide how to group visits based on where they are. The system will look at which places are close to each other and put them in clusters. This helps make routes better by putting nearby places together.

## Balanced Clustering
If you want things to be more fair and even, this option is for you. With balanced clustering, the system makes sure that visits are divided equally among clusters before deciding how to group them based on location. This is great when you want every vehicle to have a similar amount of work and still have optimized routes.

## To access the visit clustering configuration options:

1. Navigate to the Routing/Configuration menu.
2. Click the checkbox labeled "Clustering."
3. Choose either "Clustering Normal" or "Clustering Balanced" based on your preferences.

## Example Clustering Illustrations

For a visual understanding, refer to the example illustrations below:

**Normal Clustering**

**Balanced Clustering**
As you can observe, by utilizing the same visits and vehicles from the previous routing, the balanced clustering guarantees that all vehicles receive their respective visits.
