4. Information of the Bill, this is where you put the individual order of this bill
5. ID number of the order, you could use an ID multiple time if there are multiple order for that ID, for example, if a user order 3 different product, this ID should have 3 different product linked to it. This ID is linked to the (2) Main page.
