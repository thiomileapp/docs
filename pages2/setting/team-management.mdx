The teams' feature will enable your organization to have more granular task management, where each hub can have several teams and task data will be scoped to the corresponding team.

*   Teams are **optional.**
*   Users **without a team** are not restricted and can be seen and assigned tasks by all users.
*   **Owners** automatically get access to all teams in their organization.

### Team Rules in User Assignment:

1. **Users Without Teams**: If a user doesn't belong to any team, it means that the user is NOT RESTRICTED in task assignments.
    *   They have the ability to view and be viewed by all users within the organization.
    *   Tasks can be assigned to users without teams by any user,
2. **Users With Teams**: If a logged-in user has a team, they can view users who do not have teams and users who belong to the same team as them.
3. **Selecting Team Members**:
    *   Users are unable to select or assign tasks to users who are not members of the same team.
    *   This ensures that tasks are assigned exclusively to relevant team members, enhancing task management efficiency.
4. **Creating New Teams**: When a user creates a new team, for example, Team A and Team B, they are automatically set as members of Team A and Team B. This streamlines the team creation process and avoids duplication of efforts.
5. **Automatic Owner Access**:
    *   Owners of the organization are automatically granted access to all newly created teams.
    *   This grants owners visibility and control over all aspects of the organization.
    *   Owners maintain the ability to view all users and tasks within the organization, enabling effective monitoring and management.
    *   These rules are consistent for all owners in the organization, regardless of who initially registered the organization.
    *   Newly invited owners immediately receive access to all teams, enabling their contribution to organizational management.

If you don't see this Team menu, please activate the necessary **permissions** by navigating to "Setting/Permission" and heading to the "Setting" category.
