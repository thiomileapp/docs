1. Click on the "New" button.
2. Enter a unique name for your hub.
3. Use the map to select a location within your country. You can also drag the hub icon on the map to pinpoint your specific location.
4. Once a location is selected, the Address and Coordinates will be automatically populated.
5. Click "Save" to create the new hub.

*   You can only select locations within countries supported by MileApp: Indonesia, Singapore, New Zealand, Vietnam, Australia, Malaysia, Japan, USA, and Philippines.
*   You cannot select location outside your country

## Delete Hub
Before proceeding to delete a hub, it is essential to ensure that **no users should be assigned to the hub** you intend to delete. To unassign users, navigate to Settings ➝ User page and ensure the hub is unassigned for every user associated with it.
When considering the deletion of a Hub, exercise caution as the process is irreversible and will permanently erase all associated information, including Task details, Vehicle information, and other data contained within the Hub.

If you have completed tasks within the hub, you cannot delete it directly. For assistance or further guidance, please contact our support team.

Upon deleting a hub, you can review the associated information on the [Setting ➝ Trash](https://web.mile.app/setting/trash) page.
