title: "How to Delete a Visit"
---

To delete a visit, you can do this from the [Task](https://web.mile.app/tasks/task) page. For example, if the "Eva Lundgren" task is deleted, it will also disappear from the Visit page because the Task and Visit pages are synced. <img src="https://t3837933.p.clickup-attachments.com/t3837933/38ce1ba2-6eeb-4abb-8b2d-a1b02d461033/image.png" alt="" />
