### Routing Result History

Click the icon to display a list of available changes made to the routing results over time. <img src="https://t3837933.p.clickup-attachments.com/t3837933/62097dfa-8ba6-4e05-b91c-33ce1bf41816/image.png" alt="" />

Click "Yes" to continue restoring version: <img src="https://t3837933.p.clickup-attachments.com/t3837933/ab709181-938c-407d-b8ff-be4761210937/image.png" alt="" /> **Note**: When you click "Restore" on the current version, it will not add another entry to the history, and the result will remain unchanged. Restoration only reverts the routing to a specific previous change. For example, if you have two history entries: 1. "2 visits moved to vehicle B by Owner" (this is the current version) 2. "Visit Place A moved to vehicle A by Owner" If you click "Restore" on the second entry, it will cancel the latest change, meaning the visit "Place A" will be moved back to "vehicle A", reverting to the state of the routing at that specific change.

#### Reset Routing Result

If you need to revert your changes to the original state, simply click the "Reset" button. This will undo all modifications, and the reverted record will appear in the history results. <img src="https://t3837933.p.clickup-attachments.com/t3837933/63613bd8-adfd-4f40-8313-ca5c576efae7/image.png" alt="" />
