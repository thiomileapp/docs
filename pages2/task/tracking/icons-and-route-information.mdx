title: "Icons and Route Information"
---

There are a few icons and information cards that you could find on the [Tracking page](https://web.mile.app/tasks/tracking) as your field user using the mobile app and finishing their task.

Some icons and cards will be displayed by default, while some will only be displayed if the user has done certain actions, if the task carries specific information, or after they Start or Finish their work.

## User Icon

The user icon will show you the latest location of the user on the map. You could click the user icon to show a card that contains more detail about the total task, done task, ongoing task, location history, and last updated information from that user. This information is visible both when you click a user icon on the all Active User view, or when you view a specific Active User activity after you click their name on the Active list.

Detail explanation for each information on the information card: \*   **Last update**

The last update time is the most recent location history update from this user, the location history is generated when the user uses their mobile app and for better accuracy, you should use the [Start Finish feature](https://web.mile.app/setting/permission) so the location history could be generated properly.

\*   **Total Task**

The total task counts both the Done & Ongoing tasks from that user on that specific date.

\*   **Done Task**

The total amount of tasks that the user has finished on that specific date, the tracking page will show the finished task based on its Done time.

\*   **Ongoing Task**

The total amount of ongoing task that the user currently worked on or haven't done on that specific date, the tracking page will show the Ongoing task based on its Start Time. You could see the Start Time for each Task on the task list and the task detail.

This is generated from the task title, if the task title is not mapped at the [flow configuration](https://web.mile.app/flow/flow) setting. We will show the flow name as the title of this done task information card.

2. **Assignee**

The name of the user that finishes this task.

3. **Task Status**

Status of this task. "Done" means the task has been finished.

4. **Task Content**

Customizable task content that could be mapped at the [flow configuration](https://web.mile.app/flow/flow) setting. If the value is empty or the task content is not mapped, this content won't be shown.

5. **Task Label**

Customizable task label that could be mapped at the [flow configuration](https://web.mile.app/flow/flow) setting. If the value is empty or the task content is not mapped, this label won't be shown.

6. **Task Address**

The task address will be displayed on this card if you map the routing configuration at the [flow configuration](https://web.mile.app/flow/flow) setting. If the value is empty or the task content is not mapped, this address won't be shown.

7. **Planned ETA**

Planned ETA is the estimated arrival time that is generated from the [route optimization](https://web.mile.app/route/visit) process, only the task that is optimized and dispatched from the [routing result](https://web.mile.app/route/result) will have this value. If you didn't optimize the task this value won't be shown.

8. **Planned ETD**

This value is similar to the Planned ETA value, it will always display in pair because the Planned ETD is the estimated departure time that is also generated from the [route optimization](https://web.mile.app/route/visit) process. If you didn't [optimize and dispatch](https://web.mile.app/route/result) the task this value won't be shown.

9. **Arrival Time**

Arrival Time is the actual time when the user arrives at the task location, this data will be sent automatically from the user's mobile app.

10. **Depart Time**

Depart Time is the actual time when the user finishes the task, this data will be sent automatically from the user's mobile app.

## Ongoing Task Icon

The Ongoing Task icon will display plenty of information about the ongoing task, the icon will show you the location of the ongoing task.

Beside that you could also hover the icon for

### Ongoing Task that is Dispatched from the Route Optimization

When you hover over the Ongoing Task icon that is dispatched from the route optimization. A tooltip will appear that will show you the estimated arrival time of this user, and if the user is estimated to be late at their next task location, we will show the estimation of how much is the delay.

This tooltip will appear if these two requirements are fulfilled: \*   The task has been optimized and dispatched from the [route optimization](https://web.mile.app/route/visit) menu. \*   The user location history is updated, or the [Start Finish feature](https://web.mile.app/setting/permission) is active for that user so the user location history and time are recorded properly.

If those two conditions are fulfilled, new information will be generated for this Ongoing task icon, and you could see this tooltip when you hover over the Ongoing Task icon:

<img src="https://t3837933.p.clickup-attachments.com/t3837933/da03beaa-cf89-4544-9547-2d5ea543a32f/image.png" alt="" /> \*   **ETA**

_Example from the picture above: ETA 14:25_

This ETA will show you the **estimated arrival time of the user to this task location,** the calculation is based on the Last Update location of the user and the travel time that they need to reach this task location from their latest location history.

\*   **Delay Estimate**

_Example from the picture above: (+5 mins)_

This information will **only be displayed if the user is estimated to be late to reach their next task location compared to the ETA** that is generated from the route optimization process.

For example: if the user is expected to be late 5 minutes compared to their ETA time, the tooltip will show the extra information (+5 mins).

But, if the user is expected to reach their next location within the ETA or earlier than the ETA, this extra information won't be displayed.

### Ongoing Task that is Not Optimize at Routing

If you hover above the Ongoing Task icon that is not optimized in the Routing menu, a tooltip will appear that will show you the estimated arrival time of this user. The ETA is calculated based on the user's last update location and the location of the next task in the queue.

<img src="https://t3837933.p.clickup-attachments.com/t3837933/027a6a5c-ac2f-4904-8ac7-c60e93952bca/image.png" alt="" /> **ETA,** _Example from the picture above: ETA 07:20_ This ETA will show you the **estimated arrival time of the user to this task location,** the calculation is based on the Last Update location of the user and the travel time that they need to reach this task location from their latest location history.

This feature enhances task management by providing users with valuable ETA predictions for tasks that are not been optimized within the routing menu. This feature will enable better decision-making, more transparency for your customer, improved customer service, and resource optimization, ultimately contributing to more efficient and effective task execution.

This feature is also compatible to calculate mixed task; which is a combination of task that is not Optimized at Routing, and task that is Optimized through the Routing menu seamlessly.

For example, see the picture below: <img src="https://t3837933.p.clickup-attachments.com/t3837933/721f1131-76df-43b9-9a89-350183218123/image.png" alt="" /> **A.** This is the last updated location history of the Field user. **B.** This is the "next task location"; we get the user's ETA to this location by calculating the time the user needs to reach the next task location from their last updated location. **C.** To calculate the task ETA after the "next task location"; we will calculate the time that is needed to get to the next task from the previous task location. We will repeat this calculation indefinitely as needed. For example, if you have 50 Tasks, this process is repeated for each task.

### Ongoing Task Information Card
