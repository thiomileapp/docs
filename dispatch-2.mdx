Once you are satisfied with the optimization results, you can dispatch them. After dispatching, the tasks on the Task page will automatically be updated based on these results.
If you assign these visits to a user, that user will also be able to access the tasks from their mobile app.

Information from the optimization results will be used to update this task. This information includes the time window for the task, task order, and task assignment. If you leave the user field **empty**, the task will also become **unassigned**. These additional details can be viewed on the Task page:
