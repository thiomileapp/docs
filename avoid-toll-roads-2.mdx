The **Avoid Toll Roads** setting allows you to exclude toll roads from the route optimization process.
When this setting is enabled, the system will calculate and recommend the most efficient route **without using toll roads**, helping you plan routes that fit your operational preferences or cost-saving needs.

Required Permission :
*   View configuration
*   Create configuration
*   Edit configuration

### **How to Activate Avoid Toll Roads**
1. Go to the **Routing → Configuration** menu.
2. Check the **“Avoid Toll Roads”** option.
Once activated, the route optimization will automatically exclude toll roads when generating routes.

You can disable this option anytime if you want the system to include toll roads again in future optimizations.
