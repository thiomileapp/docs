## Overview

MileApp uses conventional HTTP response codes to indicate the success or failure of an API request.

- Codes in the **2xx** range indicate success
- Codes in the **4xx** range indicate an error that failed given the information provided
- Codes in the **5xx** range indicate an error with MileApp's servers (these are rare)

## HTTP Status Codes

| Code | Text | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| 200 | Success | Indicates that the request has succeeded. |
| 201 | Created | Indicates that the request has succeeded and has led to the creation of a resource. |
| 400 | Bad Request | Indicates that the server cannot or will not process the request due to something that is perceived to be a client error (for example, malformed request syntax, invalid request message framing, or deceptive request routing). |
| 401 | Unauthorized | Indicates that the client request has not been completed because it lacks valid authentication credentials for the requested resource. |
| 404 | Not Found | This status code is returned when the request contains invalid ID or URL itself. |
| 405 | Method not Allowed | Indicates that the server knows the request method, but the target resource doesn't support this method. |
| 406 | Not Acceptable | Indicates that the server cannot produce a response matching the list of acceptable values defined in the request's proactive content negotiation headers. Only `application/json` and `*/*` are supported. |
| 409 | Conflict | Indicates a request conflict with current state of the target resource. |
| 413 | Payload Too Large | Indicates that the request entity is larger than limits defined by server. |
| 429 | Too Many Requests | Indicates the user has sent too many requests in a given amount of time. |
| 500 | Unexpected Server Error | Indicates error at MileApp's side (these are rare). |
| 502 | Bad Gateway | Indicates that the server, while acting as a gateway or proxy, received an invalid response from the upstream server (these are rare). |
| 503 | Service Unavailable | Indicates the server is not ready to handle the request (these are rare). |
| 504 | Gateway Timeout | Indicates that the server did not get a response in time that it needed in order to complete the request (these are rare). |

## Error Response Format

When an error occurs, the API returns a JSON response with the following structure:

```json
{
  "status": false,
  "message": "Error description here"
}
```
