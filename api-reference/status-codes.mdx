## Overview

MileApp uses conventional HTTP response codes to indicate the success or failure of an API request.

- Codes in the **2xx** range indicate success
- Codes in the **4xx** range indicate an error that failed given the information provided
- Codes in the **5xx** range indicate an error with MileApp's servers (these are rare)

## HTTP Status Codes

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Public API">
    | Code | Text | Description |
    |------|------|-------------|
    | 200 | Success | Indicates that the request has succeeded. |
    | 201 | Created | Indicates that the request has succeeded and has led to the creation of a resource. |
    | 400 | Bad Request | Indicates that the server cannot or will not process the request due to something that is perceived to be a client error (for example, malformed request syntax, invalid request message framing, or deceptive request routing). |
    | 401 | Unauthorized | Indicates that the client request has not been completed because it lacks valid authentication credentials for the requested resource. |
    | 404 | Not Found | This status code is returned when the request contains invalid ID or URL itself. |
    | 405 | Method not Allowed | Indicates that the server knows the request method, but the target resource doesn't support this method. |
    | 406 | Not Acceptable | Indicates that the server cannot produce a response matching the list of acceptable values defined in the request's proactive content negotiation headers. Only `application/json` and `*/*` are supported. |
    | 409 | Conflict | Indicates a request conflict with current state of the target resource. |
    | 413 | Payload Too Large | Indicates that the request entity is larger than limits defined by server. |
    | 429 | Too Many Requests | Indicates the user has sent too many requests in a given amount of time. |
    | 500 | Unexpected Server Error | Indicates error at MileApp's side (these are rare). |
    | 502 | Bad Gateway | Indicates that the server, while acting as a gateway or proxy, received an invalid response from the upstream server (these are rare). |
    | 503 | Service Unavailable | Indicates the server is not ready to handle the request (these are rare). |
    | 504 | Gateway Timeout | Indicates that the server did not get a response in time that it needed in order to complete the request (these are rare). |
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Internal API">
    | Code | Text | Description |
    |------|------|-------------|
    | 200 | Success | Indicates that the request has succeeded. |
    | 201 | Created | Indicates that the request has succeeded and has led to the creation of a resource. |
    | 400 | Bad Request | For example, the `Create Task` requires `flow` type to be sent and if it is missing, the status code is returned. |
    | 401 | Unauthorized | For example, all API requires the API key to be sent and if it is missing, the status code is returned. |
    | 404 | Not Found | This status code is returned when the request contains invalid ID or URL itself. For example, the `Read Task by ID` API requires taskid to be sent and if it is incorrect ID, the status code is returned. |
    | 405 | Method not Allowed | This API request used the wrong HTTP method. For example, API `Get Task by ID` used GET method, when you sent PUT method, the status code is returned. |
    | 406 | Unsupported Accept Header | Only `application/json` and `*/*` are supported. |
    | 409 | Conflict | Indicates a request conflict with current state of the target resource. |
    | 413 | Payload Too Large | Indicates that the request entity is larger than limits defined by server. |
    | 429 | Too Many Requests | Indicates the user has sent too many requests in a given amount of time. |
    | 500 | Unexpected Server Error | This indicates error at MileApp's side. |
    | 503 | Service Unavailable | The server is not ready to handle the request. |
    | 504 | Gateway Timeout | Indicates that the server did not get a response in time that it needed in order to complete the request. |

    Most errors will also return a message containing more information to help you debug.

## Error Response Format

When an error occurs, the API returns a JSON response with the following structure:

```json
{
  "status": false,
  "message": "Error description here"
}
```

## Failed Code System

<Note>
The Failed Code System is available for **Internal API** responses only.
</Note>

All failed responses include a standardized `failedCode` field to provide machine-readable failed identification. This enables consistent failed handling across different languages and integrations.

### Failed Code Format

The failed code follows a structured format: **`{module}-{type}`**

- **Module Code**: Identifies the system component (max 5 characters)
- **Failed Type Code**: Identifies the specific failed type (3-digit number)

### Module Codes Reference

| Module | Module Codes | Description |
|--------|--------------|-------------|
| **Authentication** | `auth` | Manages user authentication and authorization, controlling access to system resources and functionality. |
| **Task** | `task`, `sched`, `lochi`, `disp` | Handles the complete lifecycle of task resources, from creation and scheduling to dispatch and real-time location tracking. |
| **Routing** | `route`, `vehic`, `conf`, `geo`, `capac`, `reslt`, `rhist` | Provides a comprehensive suite for route optimization and planning, including vehicle management, capacity constraints, and result logging. |
| **Flow** | `flow`, `auto`, `templ`, `flog` | Handles the creation and management of flow templates—the blueprints for repeatable processes. |
| **Data Management** | `data`, `dtype` | Governs the management of all data sources and data types within the organization. |
| **Settings** | `user`, `role`, `hub`, `passp`, `priv`, `cmod`, `orgdt`, `org`, `team`, `perm`, `trash`, `appin` | Manages the core administrative and configuration entities. |
| **Billing** | `lcns`, `subs`, `invce`, `pymnt` | Handles all billing and subscription operations. |
| **Data Version** | `dver` | Implements data versioning for critical resources. |
| **App Version** | `versn` | Responsible for application version management. |
| **System** | `sys` | Contains system-level operations and configurations. |

### Common Failed Code Examples

| `sys-036` | Rate limit exceeded | Too many requests |
| `sys-045` | Internal server error | Internal server error |

### Business Logic Errors (031-099)

<Warning>
Business logic failed codes are **module-specific**. Each module may implement the same failed code differently based on its business context. For example, `task-033` means "Task not found", while `user-033` means "User not found". Always consider the module prefix when handling these failures.
</Warning>

<Accordion title="View all business logic error codes">
| Code | General Description | Common Causes |
|------|---------------------|---------------|
| `031` | Duplicate entry | Record already exists |
| `032` | Invalid state/condition | Operation not allowed in current state |
| `033` | Not found | Resource doesn't exist |
| `034` | Unauthorized access | Missing or invalid authentication |
| `035` | Forbidden operation | Insufficient permissions |
