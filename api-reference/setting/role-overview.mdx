## What is Role?

This API enables you to retrieve a list of predefined roles and any custom roles associated with your account. By making a GET request to this API, you can obtain information about the available roles within the system. The predefined roles refer to a set of role types that are already defined by the system. In this particular case, the predefined roles include Finance, Owner, Planner, Admin, and Field User. Additionally, the API may also return any custom roles that have been created within your account.
