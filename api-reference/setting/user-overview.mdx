## What is User?

User data includes information contained within a user account, such as details that define a user's hub access and role within the system. Hub access determines the locations or areas of the application a user can access or the specific actions they can perform. User attributes consist of the user ID, name, email, and status.

MileApp provides five predefined user roles, and you can create custom roles based on your organization's needs. The predefined roles are **Owner, Admin, Planner, and Field user**. A user can only hold one role at a time but can be granted access to multiple hubs.
