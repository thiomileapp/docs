## What is Data Source?

The Data source could help you simplify the process of filling in task information based on existing data at MileApp. This data could consist of information such as name, number, date, coordinate, and multiple options. The Data typically represents entities such as customers, products, employees, suppliers, or any other critical data elements that are used across the application.
