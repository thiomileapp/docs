1. **Minimum Task**
*   The number of tasks is calculated only when the task is created. Updating a task does **not** consume your task quota. However, **deleted tasks still count** toward the quota. For **Pro plans**, you get limit **2,500 tasks**. Any tasks beyond this limit will be **charged IDR 1,000 per task**.
2. **Maximum Vehicles per Routing**
*   Refers to the **maximum number of active vehicles** that can be included during route optimization. You can perform routing multiple times, but the number of vehicles involved in each optimization is limited by your plan.
3. **Automation**
*   Indicates the **number of active automation flows** allowed in your plan. Only those automations currently active are counted. Automations of type **"Create Task"** and **"Create and Assign Task"** are **not counted** toward this limit.
4. **Data Source**
*   Refers to the **types and amount of master data** used for automating task creation—such as SKUs, outlets, and customers. For example, “3 x 100” means you can use 3 data types (e.g., outlets, products, agents) with up to 100 entries each. The Free plan allows **2 data types, 2,500 rows total**, while the Pro allows **5 data types, 10,000 rows total**.
5. **Maximum Components per Flow**
*   Refers to the **maximum component** in a single flow. 100 in Free, 200 in Pro, and **unlimited or as needed** in Enterprise.
