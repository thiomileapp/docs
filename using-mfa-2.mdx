After MFA is enabled for your role, you will encounter the OTP input page during the sign-in process. Here's how to use MFA with Email OTP:

1. Enter your username and password as usual on the sign-in page.
2. Click the "Sign In" button.
3. Check your registered email address for the OTP.
4. Enter the OTP in the designated field on the sign-in page.
5. Click the "Verify" button.
6. If you entered the correct OTP, you will gain access to your account. If the OTP is incorrect or has expired, you may need to request a new one.
