## What is a Flow?

Flow in MileApp is the mobile field application workflow. Setting it correctly is critical to the success of the field workers in doing their job efficiently. Flow attributes consist of IDs, pages, components, configurations, and time. The Flow will be used at Task, Automation, or Schedule.

A Flow defines:
- **Pages** - The screens that field workers see in the mobile app
- **Components** - Input fields, photos, signatures, and other data capture elements
- **Configurations** - Settings for how the flow behaves
- **Validations** - Rules for data entry requirements
