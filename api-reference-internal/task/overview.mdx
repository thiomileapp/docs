## What is a Task?

A task is an item of work intended for completion by an assignee. It can embody activities like pickups, deliveries, planning, inspections, sales visits, or other work-related actions within your organization. Tasks encompass essential attributes, including IDs, flow, time, status indicators, assignee information, order index, and other pertinent data. The content of a task is configurable based on your specified flow settings. For instance, tasks can serve as visits during the route optimization process, functioning as pivotal elements. The task can also represent a visit in route optimization, please follow [this link](/api-reference-internal/routing/overview) to read more detail.

## Bulk Operations

MileApp supports bulk operations for efficient task management:

- **Bulk Create** - Create multiple tasks in a single request
- **Bulk Update** - Update multiple tasks at once
- **Bulk Assign** - Assign multiple tasks to users
- **Bulk Move** - Move multiple tasks to different hubs
- **Bulk Delete** - Delete multiple tasks

## Integration with Route Optimization

Tasks can serve as **visits** in the route optimization module. When you create tasks with location data, they can be:

1. Included in route optimization calculations
2. Assigned to vehicles based on constraints
3. Sequenced for optimal delivery routes

For more information about route optimization, see the [Routing](/api-reference-internal/routing/overview) documentation.
