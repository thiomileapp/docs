<Warning>
Your application must return an HTTP 200 status code within 30 seconds to confirm successful receipt and avoid timeouts and retries.
</Warning>

When your application receives a webhook from our service:

1. **Return HTTP 200 quickly** - Do not include complex business logic in the initial processing
2. **Offload heavy processing** - If the webhook triggers any long-running or computationally intensive tasks, offload these to a background process or a separate system
3. **Keep handlers efficient** - This ensures that your webhook handler remains efficient and promptly returns the required HTTP 200 response

## Best Practices

### Do
- Acknowledge receipt immediately with HTTP 200
- Queue complex processing for background workers
- Log the webhook payload for debugging
- Validate the payload structure before processing

### Don't
- Perform database-heavy operations synchronously
- Make external API calls before responding
- Process large files inline
- Run complex calculations in the request handler
