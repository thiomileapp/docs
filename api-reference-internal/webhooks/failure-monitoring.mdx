Our system continuously monitors the integration's performance by tracking the success and failure rates of operations. If a significant number of failures occur, this could indicate a problem with the integration.

## Failure Threshold

| Metric | Threshold |
|--------|-----------|
| **Start counter** | Operation calculation starts from the first time a failure occurs |
| **Threshold Level** | Notification triggered if failure rate exceeds 80% with more than 5 failures, OR more than 50 total failures within 1 hour |
| **Failure Rate Calculation** | Percentage of failed operations out of total operations attempted within the monitored period |

## Notification Process

As soon as the system identifies that the failure rate has exceeded the threshold, it will automatically send an email notification to all owner emails.

The notification includes:
- The webhook endpoint that is failing
- The number of failures detected
- The time period of the failures
- Recommended actions to resolve the issue

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### High Failure Rate
- Check if your endpoint is accessible from the internet
- Verify your SSL certificate is valid
- Ensure your server can handle the incoming traffic

### Timeout Errors
- Optimize your webhook handler to respond faster
- Move heavy processing to background jobs
- Consider scaling your infrastructure

### HTTP 5xx Errors
- Check your server logs for application errors
- Verify database connections are healthy
- Review recent code deployments
