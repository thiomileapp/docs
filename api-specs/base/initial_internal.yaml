    # Introduction

    Welcome to MileApp API Documentation! You can use this API to access all our API endpoints. All request and response bodies, including errors, are encoded in JSON. MileApp API provides a suite of simple and flexible API endpoints to read, modify, add or delete data.

    ## Overview
    
    MileApp APIs are plain JSON over HTTP and use the following HTTP verbs:

     | COMMAND | PURPOSE |
     |---|---|
     | GET | The GET method is employed for straightforward information retrieval concerning your account, resources, or environment. This read-only operation ensures that the requested information is returned in the form of a JSON object. The attributes within this object can then be leveraged to formulate additional queries. Importantly, any request made using the GET method is purely informational and does not bring about changes to the queried objects. |
     | POST | When the goal is to create a new object, the POST method is specified in the request. This method includes all the attributes necessary for the creation of a new object. Initiating a POST request to the target endpoint triggers the process of creating a new resource. |
     | PUT | For updating information pertaining to a resource in your account, the PUT method is available. Similar to the DELETE method, PUT is idempotent. It facilitates the setting of the target state using provided values, irrespective of the current state of those values. Requests using the PUT method eliminate the need to inspect the current attributes of the object being modified. |
     | PATCH | Certain resources support partial modifications, and for these cases, the PATCH method comes into play. In contrast to PUT, which typically demands a complete representation of a resource, a PATCH request is a set of instructions detailing how to modify a resource, focusing only on specific attributes that require updating. |
     | DELETE | When the objective is to permanently remove a resource from your account and environment, the DELETE method is utilized. This method is characterized by its idempotent nature, meaning that whether the specified object is found or not, the end result remains the same. If the object exists, it is deleted; if not, a response indicates its non-existence. |
    
     
    Note: All API requests should hit the secured endpoint: HTTPS
    
    ## Rate Limit
    
    This limit is applied on an organization wide basis irrespective of factors such as the number of agents or IP addresses used to make the calls.
    
    
     | Limit Hit | Time |
     |---|---|
     | 100 | 1 second |
    
    ## Format
    
    In the modeling environment there are the following model types for modeling global data types. A global data type is modeled with format, example and description.
    
     | Data Type | Description |
     |---|---|
     | Integer | An integer data type represents some range of mathematical integers.<br>Integral data types may be of different sizes and may or may not be allowed to contain negative values.<br><b>Example:</b><br><span style="color:#9012fe; font-weight:bolder;">10, 200, 2500</span> |
     | Float | Float number, also known as a floating-point number consists of a set of digits and a decimal point, which separates the fractional part of the number from the whole part.<br>The term "floating" refers to the fact that the decimal point can "float" to represent values with a varying number of digits before and after the decimal point.<br><b>Example:</b><br><span style="color:#9012fe; font-weight:bolder;">2.1, 14.2, 100.5</span> |
     | String | Alphanumeric characters<br><b>Example:</b><br><span style="color:#9012fe; font-weight:bolder;">Jakarta50, Malang, Solo Raya, 45, Bandung_90an</span> |
     | Boolean | Representing logical values.<br><b>Example:</b><br><span style="color:#9012fe; font-weight:bolder;">TRUE, FALSE</span> |
     | Datetime | The DateTime value type represents dates and times.<br>with values ranging from 00:00:00 (midnight), January 1, 0001 Anno Domini (Common Era)<br>through 11:59:59 P.M., December 31, 9999 A.D. (C.E.) in the Gregorian calendar.<br><b>Format:</b><br><span style="color:#9012fe; font-weight:bolder;">Y-m-d H:i:s<br>Y-m-d\TH:i:s.vP<br>Y-m-d\TH:i:sP</span><br><b>Example:</b><br><span style="color:#9012fe; font-weight:bolder;">2022-07-13 03:16:40<br>2022-07-13T03:16:40+00:00<br>2022-07-13T03:16:40</span> |
     | Time | The TIME data type consists of a time in hour, minutes, seconds, optional fractions of a second, and optional time zone.<br><b>Format:</b><br><span style="color:#9012fe; font-weight:bolder;">H:i:s<br>H:i</span><br><b>Example:</b><br><span style="color:#9012fe; font-weight:bolder;">08:30:00<br>08:30</span> |
     | Object | An Object data type is a method for encoding key-value pairs.<br>A single field value may contain one or more sets of key-value pairs.<br><b>Format:</b><br><pre style="color:#9012fe; font-weight:bolder;">{key1: value1,key2: value2,keyN: valueN}</pre> |
     | Array | An array type is a user-defined data type consisting of an ordered set of elements of a single data type.<br>in this case, elements of a single data type is String<br><b>Format for <span style="color:#9012fe; font-weight:bolder;">Array of String</span>:</b><br><pre style="color:#9012fe; font-weight:bolder;">["string1", "string2", "stringN"]</pre><b>Format for <span style="color:#9012fe; font-weight:bolder;">Array of Objects</span>:</b><br><pre style="color:#9012fe; font-weight:bolder;">[{"object":"1"},{"object":"2"},{"object":"n"}] |
     
    ## Status Code
    
    Description: Response from POST data will return json data which contain status with HTTP status code = 200.
    
    
    Success has the status code 200.
    
    
    Error has the status code 4xx and contains error message in the body. Refer to the table below to understand what each code means.
    
    | Error Code | Text | Description |
      |---|---|---|
      | 401 | Unauthorized | For example, all API requires the API key to be sent and if it is missing, the status code is returned |
      | 400 | Bad Request | For example, the `Create Task` requires `flow` type to be sent and if it is missing, the status code is returned |
      | 404 | Not Found | This status code is returned when the request contains invalid ID or URL itself. For example, the `Read Task by ID` API requires taskid to be sent and if it is incorrect ID, the status code is returned |
      | 405 | Method not Allowed | This API request used the wrong HTTP method. For example, API `Get Task by ID` used GET method, when you sent PUT method, the status code is returned, as this API allows only GET method |
      | 406 | Unsupported Accept Header | Only application/json and */* are supported |
      | 409 | Conflict | Indicates a request conflict with current state of the target resource |
      | 413 | Payload Too Large | Indicates that the request entity is larger than limits defined by server |
      | 429 | Too Many Requests | Indicates the user has sent too many requests in a given amount of time |
      | 500 | Unexpected Server Error | This indicate error at MileApp’s side |
      | 503 | Service Unavailable | The server is not ready to handle the request |
      | 504 |	Gateway Timeout | Indicates that the server did not get a response in time that it needed in order to complete the request |
    
    
    Most errors will also return a message contains more information to help you debug.
    
    
    For example, `Create Task` requires `flow` and if it is missing, the status code 400 will returned and some message will show

  - name: Activity
    description: Activity represents a master-child task structure created from workflow templates. An activity consists of a master task using ActivityWorkflow flow and multiple child tasks (steps) based on workflow configuration. Activities provide comprehensive task management with status synchronization, assignment coordination, and workflow-based automation for complex business processes.

  - name: Workflow
    description: Workflow is a template system for creating multi-step task processes with field mappings between steps. It defines the sequence of flows (task types) that need to be completed, allowing for data transfer and transformation between steps. Workflows serve as reusable templates for complex business processes and can be used to create activities with master-child task architecture.
