# ============ TASK MODULE ============
Task: |
  A task is an item of work intended for completion by an assignee. It can embody activities like pickups, deliveries, planning, inspections, sales visits, or other work-related actions within your organization. Tasks encompass essential attributes, including IDs, flow, time, status indicators, assignee information, order index, and other pertinent data. The content of a task is configurable based on your specified flow settings. For instance, tasks can serve as visits during the route optimization process, functioning as pivotal elements. The task can also represent a visit in route optimization, please follow [this link](#tag/Routing) to read more detail.

Task Schedule: |
  Task Schedule is a mechanism to generate tasks according to the schedule that is set by you. The task schedule attributes consist of IDs, repetition period data (daily, weekly, etc.), flow structure, task content, and time of the schedule's start & end. This schedule could help you to set a task that will be repeated at a certain period.

  **To see the details of task schedule object, please follow [this link](#tag/task_schedule_model)**

Activity: |
  An Activity represents a workflow execution instance consisting of multiple sequential tasks (steps). Each activity is a master task that orchestrates a series of child tasks based on a predefined workflow. Activities enable you to manage complex multi-step processes where each step can be assigned to different workers and tracked independently. The activity master automatically updates its status based on the completion of child tasks through the ActivityConsumer. Activity attributes consist of IDs, workflow reference, child task IDs (subId array), aggregated assignees, status indicators, and embedded workflow data.

# ============ ROUTING MODULE ============
Vehicle: |
  The vehicle represents a car, bike, truck, or other form of transportation used in your organization. They are utilized to optimize the route planning process, determining the most efficient path for completing multiple tasks or visits. The vehicle attributes contain IDs, capacity, speed, working hours, tags, and constraints.

  **To see the details of vehicle object, please follow [this link](#tag/vehicle_model)**

Routing: |
  The **Routing** refers to process of finding the most effective routes for vehicles to travel from one visit to another. The optimization process will generate a result that could update the respective task data when dispatched. With the ability to handle complex constraints and variables such as capacity, time windows, and vehicle availability, the API can be customized to meet the specific needs of any business or organization.

  **This section is for the v2 of routing api, if you still use the old one, please follow [this link](/v1) to see documentation**.

  **Routing results** are collection of route optimization's results that already successfully processed and saved in the database. Routing results contains list of routed visits and dropped visits.

  1. Routed visits are sequence recommendation of visits/tasks list according to most suitable vehicle and best route.
  2. Dropped visits are list of tasks/visits that out of range of the calculation.

  **To see the details of routing object, please follow [this link](#tag/route_model)**

  ## Why use Route Optimization

  With Route Optimization API, you can establish or refine an automated dispatch or route planning process that improves the operational efficiency of your transportation needs. With parameters to express your unique operational objectives and constraints, and an algorithm built on top of the trusted Google Maps data, the service generates the best possible route plans to meet those constraints. Some use-case examples follow:

  - A **logistics company** uses Route Optimization to optimize the assignments of all next-day shipments, providing a route for each shipment that optimizes for distance and time efficiency, cost saving, on time delivery, and driver and end customer satisfaction.

  - A **field service provider** uses Route Optimization to find the optimal route and sequence for technician's service appointments, and re-optimize when condition changes occur, such as en route delays.

  - An **on demand food delivery** company uses Route Optimization in their real-time dispatch process to choose the best active driver to pick up several new orders and insert it in their existing routes.

  - A **medical service provider** uses Route Optimization to map health providers to appointments, improving the efficiency of the routes for each provider across their day.

  ## How Route Optimization works

  The Route Optimization API uses a number of inputs to return a route plan. Inputs include vehicles, visits or shipments, configurations, and constraints. A route plan includes tasks assignment to vehicles, the multi-stop routes for each vehicle, and the related metrics.

Configuration: |
  Configuration endpoints for managing routing and optimization settings including time windows, constraints, and optimization parameters.

Capacity Constraint: |
  Capacity Constraint endpoints for managing vehicle capacity constraints in route optimization. Define weight, volume, and other capacity limits for vehicles.

Geocode: |
  Geocode endpoints for address geocoding and location services. Convert addresses to coordinates and vice versa.

Geotagging: |
  Geotagging endpoints for location tagging and geographic data management.

Geo Tagging: |
  Geotagging endpoints for location tagging and geographic data management.

Routing Result: |
  Routing results are collection of route optimization's results that already successfully processed and saved in the database. Routing results contains list of routed visits and dropped visits:
  1. Routed visits are sequence recommendation of visits/tasks list according to most suitable vehicle and best route.
  2. Dropped visits are list of tasks/visits that out of range of the calculation.

# ============ FLOW MODULE ============
Flow: |
  Flow in MileApp is the mobile field application workflow, setting it correctly is critical to the success of the field workers in doing their job efficiently. Flow attributes consist of IDs, pages, components, configurations, and time. The Flow will be used at Task, Automation, or Schedule.

  **To see the details of flow object, please follow [this link](#tag/flow_model)**

Automation: |
  Automation enables you to set up automation based on tasks' events and data source's events. It might help you automate creation of tasks, task assignment, task placement, task webhook, data source update, datasource creation, and data source webhook. Automation attributes consist of IDs, automation name, automation type, automation details, and rules.

  **To see the details of automation object, please follow [this link](#tag/automation_model)**

Webhook: |
  A webhook is a mechanism in web development and APIs that allows real-time communication between applications or services. It enables one application to send data to another application whenever a specific event or trigger occurs. Webhooks are commonly used to automate and integrate systems, enabling seamless data exchange and event-driven workflows. In our end, you can follow [this doc](https://doc.clickup.com/3837933/p/h/3n3zd-81962/aa00834626ae24f/3n3zd-154042) to set up the webhook.

  ## How does it work

  When your application endpoint is enabled on MileApp to receive events, MileApp will push real-time notifications to it. These notifications contain the type of event, the epoch timestamp of when it occurred, and any relevant data for that event. On your side you can then use that to integrate MileApp with existing or new software.

  ## Delivery Attempts and Retries

  When viewing information about a specific event through the [Automation](https://web.mile.app/flow/automation) tab, there will be information about how many times MileApp attempted to send an event to the endpoint. This shows the latest response from client endpoint, a list of all attempted webhooks, and the respective HTTP status codes MileApp received. There's also a retry button for manually retry webhooks.

  Our webhook is designed to ensure reliable delivery by automatically retrying under certain conditions. The key details are as follows:

  **Retry Conditions:**
  The webhook request will **retry up to 3 times** if any of the following conditions occur:
  - The server returns an **HTTP status that is not 200** (indicating failure).
  - The server takes longer than **30 seconds** to respond (timeout).

  **Retry Timing:**
  If the first attempt fails, the webhook will automatically retry **every 2 minutes**.
  - First failure → Retry after 2 minutes.
  - Second failure → Retry again after 2 minutes.
  - Third failure → Final retry after another 2 minutes.

  After **3 failed attempts**, the retry process will stop.

  ## Quick Response Requirement

  When your application receives a webhook from our service, it is crucial to return an HTTP 200 status code within 30 seconds to confirm successful receipt and avoid timeouts and retries. To maintain responsiveness, do not include complex business logic in the initial processing of the webhook. If the webhook triggers any long-running or computationally intensive tasks, offload these to a background process or a separate system.

  ## Failure Monitoring and Notification Process

  Our system continuously monitors the integration's performance by tracking the success and failure rates of operations. If a significant number of failures occur, this could indicate a problem with the integration.

  **Failure Threshold:**
  - **Start counter:** Operation calculation will start from the first time the failure occurs.
  - **Threshold Level:** If the failure rate exceeds more than 5 times and 80% or more than 50 times in total of operations within a 1-hour time frame, the system will trigger a notification event.
  - **Failure Rate Calculation:** The failure rate is calculated as the percentage of failed operations out of the total operations attempted within the monitored period.

  As soon as the system identifies that the failure rate has exceeded the threshold, it will automatically send an email notification to all owners email.
