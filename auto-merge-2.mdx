With Auto Merge, orders with the exact coordinate will be put together in the exact vehicle and back-to-back order; this will prevent orders from the same customer from being put into different vehicles, which can happen in the optimization process.
## Activate the Auto Merge**:**
To activate Auto Merge, follow these steps:
1. Go to the Routing/Configuration menu.
2. Check the "Auto Merge" checkbox.

With Auto Merge activated, visits with identical coordinates will no longer be assigned to different vehicles, ensuring optimal resource utilization.

It's important to note that the Auto Merge feature does not physically merge visits together. Instead, it ensures that visits with identical coordinates are not assigned to different vehicles.

When utilizing the Auto Merge feature in conjunction with Auto Split, visits with identical coordinates will not be split across multiple vehicles. This ensures that the integrity of the merged visits is maintained.
