Webhooks are automated messages sent from web/apps when something happens, and are sent to a unique URL. If you have a specific activity that would be processed outside of MileApp web, you could use the Webhook automation type to do that.

A Webhook action will notify the system that you prefer, which could lead to a custom action based on your needs, such as updating a dashboard, triggering a process, etc.

Webhook is a method that's commonly used by IT Engineers, so if you need to set up one, it is highly advised to ask your IT Division or Developer to help you setup a proper one.
