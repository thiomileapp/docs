The next step after you complete the Registration process is to fill in your information at our Verification process, this step is necessary to submit your Organization data to MileApp. This step will only be necessary if you are the first account to register to MileApp in your Organization.

## Verification Process
After registering using a Google account or manual sign-up, you’ll need to verify your organization information. The verification process consists of three steps that enable you to provide your personal and organization details.

The **first step** of verification is confirming your general information for your user account. You can edit your user information later in the User Settings page and Profile menu.

*   **Full Name**: Enter your full name.
*   **Organization Name**: Enter your organization or company name. You can update this later under Settings > Organization.
*   **Country**: Select your country. If you choose Indonesia, the language will default to Indonesian upon sign-in; otherwise, it will be in English.

In the **second** step, set up your first hub. You can modify this later under Settings > Hub.

*   **Hub Name**: Name your first hub, such as "Warehouse 1."
*   **Hub Location**: Search for and select the hub location on the map.

In the **third** and final step, select the flow that best suits your business process. The flow defines the task process, determining what information users can view and fill in a task. Information is organized into pages, with each page containing components tailored to the field process. You can further customize the flow later on the MileApp web platform after completing verification.
