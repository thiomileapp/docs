    "description": "# Introduction\nThe MileApp API are using RESTful API standard, which is widely recognized in the industry for its simplicity and effectiveness in designing networked applications. Our API has predictable resource-oriented URLs, accepts JSON request bodies, returns JSON-encoded responses, and uses standard HTTP response codes, authentication, and verbs. The MileApp API differs for every account as we release new versions and tailor functionality.\n## Overview\nMileApp APIs are plain JSON over HTTP and use the following HTTP verbs:\n\n | COMMAND | PURPOSE |\n |---|---|\n | GET | The GET method is employed for straightforward information retrieval concerning your account, resources, or environment. This read-only operation ensures that the requested information is returned in the form of a JSON object. The attributes within this object can then be leveraged to formulate additional queries. Importantly, any request made using the GET method is purely informational and does not bring about changes to the queried objects. |\n | POST | When the goal is to create a new object, the POST method is specified in the request. This method includes all the attributes necessary for the creation of a new object. Initiating a POST request to the target endpoint triggers the process of creating a new resource. |\n | PUT | For updating information pertaining to a resource in your account, the PUT method is available. Similar to the DELETE method, PUT is idempotent. It facilitates the setting of the target state using provided values, irrespective of the current state of those values. Requests using the PUT method eliminate the need to inspect the current attributes of the object being modified. |\n | PATCH | Certain resources support partial modifications, and for these cases, the PATCH method comes into play. In contrast to PUT, which typically demands a complete representation of a resource, a PATCH request is a set of instructions detailing how to modify a resource, focusing only on specific attributes that require updating. |\n | DELETE | When the objective is to permanently remove a resource from your account and environment, the DELETE method is utilized. This method is characterized by its idempotent nature, meaning that whether the specified object is found or not, the end result remains the same. If the object exists, it is deleted; if not, a response indicates its non-existence. |\n\n \nNote: All API requests should hit the secured endpoint: HTTPS\n## Rate Limit\nThis limit is applied on an organization wide basis irrespective of factors such as the number of agents or IP addresses used to make the calls. If a tenant exceeds these limits, they will receive a 429 error (too many requests). If you encounter a 429 error, wait 60 seconds before retrying the API request. <br> The purpose of a rate limit is to maintain a good user experience for all API users. Without a rate limit, API endpoints can flood the server with requests that overwhelm the system and negatively impact all users.\n\n\n | Limit Hit | Time |\n |---|---|\n | 100 | 1 second |\n\n## Format\nIn the modeling environment there are the following model types for modeling global data types. A global data type is modeled with format, example and description.\n\n | Data Type | Description |\n |---|---|\n | Integer | An integer data type represents some range of mathematical integers.<br>Integral data types may be of different sizes and may or may not be allowed to contain negative values.<br>**Examples:**<br>`10, 200, 2500` |\n | Float | Float number, also known as a floating-point number consists of a set of digits and a decimal point, which separates the fractional part of the number from the whole part.<br>The term \"floating\" refers to the fact that the decimal point can \"float\" to represent values with a varying number of digits before and after the decimal point.<br>**Examples:**<br>`2.1, 14.2, 100.5` |\n | String | Alphanumeric characters<br>**Examples:**<br>`\"Jakarta50\", \"Malang\", \"Solo Raya\", \"45\", \"Bandung_90an\"` |\n | Boolean | Representing logical values.<br>**Examples:**<br>`TRUE, FALSE` |\n | Datetime | The DateTime value type represents dates and times.<br>with values ranging from 00:00:00 (midnight), January 1, 0001 Anno Domini (Common Era)<br>through 11:59:59 P.M., December 31, 9999 A.D. (C.E.) in the Gregorian calendar.<br><b>Format:</b><br>`Y-m-d H:i:s`<br>`Y-m-d\\TH:i:s.vP`<br>`Y-m-d\\TH:i:sP`<br><b>Examples:</b><br>`\"2022-07-13 03:16:40\"`<br>`\"2022-07-13T03:16:40+00:00\"`<br>`\"2022-07-13T03:16:40\"` |\n | Time | The TIME data type consists of a time in hour, minutes, seconds, optional fractions of a second, and optional time zone.<br><b>Format:</b><br>`H:i:s`<br>`H:i`<br><b>Examples:</b><br>`\"08:30:00\"`<br>`\"08:30\"` |\n | Object | An Object data type is a method for encoding key-value pairs.<br>A single field value may contain one or more sets of key-value pairs.<br><b>Format:</b><br>`{\"key1\": \"value1\", \"key2\": \"value2\", \"keyN\": \"valueN\"}` |\n | Array | An array type is a user-defined data type consisting of an ordered set of elements of a single data type.<br>in this case, elements of a single data type is String<br><b>Format for **Array of String**:</b><br>`[\"string1\", \"string2\", \"stringN\"]`<b><br><br>Format for **Array of Objects**:</b><br>`[{\"object\":\"1\"},{\"object\":\"2\"},{\"object\":\"n\"}]` |\n \n## Status Code\nMileApp uses conventional HTTP response codes to indicate the success or failure of an API request. In general: <br> Codes in the **2xx** range indicate success. <br>Codes in the **4xx** range indicate an error that failed given the information provided (e.g., a required parameter was omitted, etc.). Some **4xx** errors that could be handled programmatically (e.g., a body request invalid) include an error code that briefly explains the error reported. <br>Codes in the **5xx** range indicate an error with MileApp’s servers (these are rare).\n| Code | Text | Description |\n  |---|---|---|\n  | 200 | Success | Indicates that the request has succeeded. |\n  | 201 | Created | Indicates that the request has succeeded and has led to the creation of a resource. |\n  | 401 | Unauthorized | Indicates that the client request has not been completed because it lacks valid authentication credentials for the requested resource. |\n  | 400 | Bad Request | Indicates that the server cannot or will not process the request due to something that is perceived to be a client error (for example, malformed request syntax, invalid request message framing, or deceptive request routing). |\n  | 405 | Method not Allowed | Indicates that the server knows the request method, but the target resource doesn't support this method. |\n  | 406 | Not Acceptable | Indicates that the server cannot produce a response matching the list of acceptable values defined in the request's proactive content negotiation headers, and that the server is unwilling to supply a default representation. Only `application/json` and `*/*` are supported. |\n  | 409 | Conflict | Indicates a request conflict with current state of the target resource. |\n  | 413 | Payload Too Large | Indicates that the request entity is larger than limits defined by server. |\n  | 429 | Too Many Requests | Indicates the user has sent too many requests in a given amount of time. |\n  | 500 | Unexpected Server Error | Indicates error at MileApp’s side (these are rare). |\n  | 502 | Bad Gateway | Indicates that the server, while acting as a gateway or proxy, received an invalid response from the upstream server (these are rare). |\n  | 503 | Service Unavailable | Indicates the server is not ready to handle the request (these are rare). |\n  | 504 |\tGateway Timeout | Indicates that the server did not get a response in time that it needed in order to complete the request (these are rare). |\n\n# Authentication\nMileApp authenticates your API requests using your account’s access token. If a request doesn’t include a valid key, MileApp returns an invalid request error. If a request includes a deleted or expired key, MileApp returns an authentication error. Follow the instruction to create, reveal, and delete access token.\n## Generate access token\nFor security, MileApp only shows you a secret or restricted access token one time. Store the key in a safe place where you won’t lose it. To help yourself remember where you stored it, you can leave a note on the key in the Dashboard. If you lose the key, you can delete it and create another. <br>All requests need an Bearer Token for authentication. Generate your access token here:\n- Visit <a href=\"https://web.mile.app\" target=\"_blank\">https://web.mile.app</a>.\n- Enter your user email address and password.\n- Sign in to your account.\n- Navigate to <b>Profile -> Personal Token</b>.\n- Click <b>New</b> to create a new token.\n- Fill in the token name (this is typically used to describe the token's purpose) and choose the expiration date in the Void input.\n- Click <b>Generate</b>.\n\n<b>You can't reveal a secret key that you created.</b><br> After you create a secret or restricted access token, we display the value before you save it. You must copy the value before saving it because you can’t reveal it later.\n<img src=\"https://apidoc.mile.app//assets/images/profile1.png\" alt=\"\"> <img src=\"https://apidoc.mile.app//assets/images/token2.png\" alt=\"\"> <img src=\"https://apidoc.mile.app//assets/images/copytoken3.png\" alt=\"\">\n## Protecting against key leakage\nAccess token are a form of account credentials, like a username and password. If bad actors obtain a secret key, they can use it to harm your business and other parties in the MileApp ecosystem. MileApp users own the responsibility of keeping Access token safe. Here are some best practices for how to do that.\n- Use secure key management systems (KMS) to store secret keys. When you create a secret live mode key from the MileApp Dashboard, it is only revealed once. Immediately copy the key to a KMS, which is designed to handle sensitive information with encryption and access controls. Make sure you don’t leave a copy of the key in the local file.\n- Don’t share secret keys using insecure means. Don’t share keys in emails, chat messages, or customer support messages. MileApp never asks you for your access token.\n- Don’t store keys in source code repositories (such as GitHub). Bad actors might scan public source repositories for leaked keys. Even if the source repository is private, it could be shared with team members on their development environments.\n- Don’t embed secret keys in applications. Bad actors can exploit secret keys by matching a certain string pattern in the application. Avoid embedding keys in applications such as client tools, SDKs, and mobile apps.\n\n## Handle leaked secret keys\nIf you identified a secret key leak, such as if a key is accidentally published to GitHub， immediately delete the key from MileApp Dashboard and replace your integration with the new key. If you detected abnormal behaviors without confirming that the access token is leaked, we recommended that you create new access token proactively while investigating the root cause in parallel. If MileApp detects that access token has been exposed, we will immediately notify you. It’s crucial for businesses to act promptly to reduce potential damages and financial losses caused by unauthorized use of the leaked key. Depending on the imposed risk and activity on the account, we might decide to roll the key on your behalf. In this case you will receive notifications about any action taken. MileApp doesn’t guarantee that we will detect all leaked keys. You’re responsible for following the best practices to prevent potential key leaks and ensure your integration with MileApp is secure.\n"

With parameters to express your unique operational objectives and constraints, and an algorithm built on top of the trusted Google Maps data, the service generates the best possible route plans to meet those constraints. Some use-case examples follow:\n- A **logistics company** uses Route Optimization to optimize the assignments of all next-day shipments, providing a route for each shipment that optimizes for distance and time efficiency, cost saving, on time delivery, and driver and end customer satisfaction.\n- A **field service provider** uses Route Optimization to find the optimal route and sequence for technician's service appointments, and re-optimize when condition changes occur, such as en route delays.\n- An **on demand food delivery** company uses Route Optimization in their real-time dispatch process to choose the best active driver to pick up several new orders and insert it in their existing routes.\n- A **medical service provider** uses Route Optimization to map health providers to appointments, improving the efficiency of the routes for each provider across their day.\n## How Route Optimization works\nThe Route Optimization API uses a number of inputs to return a route plan. Inputs include vehicles, visits or shipments, configurations, and constraints. A route plan includes tasks assignment to vehicles, the multi-stop routes for each vehicle, and the related metrics.\n"

      "name": "Webhook",
      "description": "A webhook is a mechanism in web development and APIs that allows real-time communication between applications or services. It enables one application to send data to another application whenever a specific event or trigger occurs. Webhooks are commonly used to automate and integrate systems, enabling seamless data exchange and event-driven workflows. In our end, you can follow <a href=\"https://doc.clickup.com/3837933/p/h/3n3zd-81962/aa00834626ae24f/3n3zd-154042\"> **this doc** </a> to set up the webhook.\n# How does it works\nWhen your application endpoint is enabled on MileApp to receive events, MileApp will push real-time notifications to it. These notifications contain the type of event, the epoch timestamp of when it occurred, and any relevant data for that event. On your side you can then use that to integrate MileApp with existing or new software.\n# Delivery Attempts and Retries\nWhen viewing information about a specific event through the <a href=\"https://webdev.mile.app/flow/automation\">Automation</a> tab, there will be and information about how many times MileApp attempted to send an event to the endpoint. This shows the latest response from client endpoint, a list of all attempted webhooks, and the respective HTTP status codes MileApp received, there also a retry button for manually retry webhooks. <br><br> <img src=\"https://v3docdev.mile.app/assets/images/retry_webhook.png\" alt=\"\"> Our webhook is designed to ensure reliable delivery by automatically retrying under certain conditions. The key details are as follows:<br><br> <b>Retry Conditions</b>:<br> The webhook request will <b>retry up to 3 times</b> if any of the following conditions occur:<br>\n    - The server returns an <b>HTTP status that is not 200</b> (indicating failure).<br>\n    - The server takes longer than <b>30 seconds</b> to respond (timeout).<br><br>\n<b>Retry Timing</b>:<br> If the first attempt fails, the webhook will automatically retry <b>every 2 minutes</b>.<br> Example:<br>\n    - First failure → Retry after 2 minutes.<br>\n    - Second failure → Retry again after 2 minutes.<br>\n    - Third failure → Final retry after another 2 minutes.<br>\nAfter <b>3 failed attempts</b>, the retry process will stop.<br><br>\nThe purpose of this approach is to ensure the reliability and responsiveness of our webhook. By automatically retrying, we can increase the likelihood of successfully delivering messages or taking other actions by the webhook. It also helps in addressing potential issues that may arise, such as slow network connections or disruptions on the server side.<br><br> Thus, our webhook has been programmed to take proactive action in addressing situations where the server response does not meet expectations or when response times exceed the specified limit.\n# Quick Response Requirement\nWhen your application receives a webhook from our service, it is crucial to return an HTTP 200 status code within 30 seconds to confirm successful receipt and avoid timeouts and retries. To maintain responsiveness, do not include complex business logic in the initial processing of the webhook. If the webhook triggers any long-running or computationally intensive tasks, offload these to a background process or a separate system. This ensures that your webhook handler remains efficient and promptly returns the required HTTP 200 response.\n# Failure Monitoring and Notification Process\nOur system continuously monitors the integration's performance by tracking the success and failure rates of operations. If a significant number of failures occur, this could indicate a problem with the integration. To ensure timely intervention, we have implemented an automated notification mechanism.<br><br> <b>Failure Threshold</b><br> - <b>Start counter:</b> Operation calculation will start from the first time the failure occurs.<br> - <b>Threshold Level:</b> If the failure rate exceeds more than 5 times and 80% or more than 50 times in total of operations within a 1-hour time frame, the system will trigger a notification event.<br> - <b>Failure Rate Calculation:</b> The failure rate is calculated as the percentage of failed operations out of the total operations attempted within the monitored period.<br><br> As soon as the system identifies that the failure rate has exceeded the threshold, it will automatically send an email notification to all owners email.\n"

Send request endpoint <a href='#tag/Flow/operation/getCreateTaskPayload' target=''> GET /flow/{flowName}/task </a> \n\n              2. Copy the response from section `bodyRequest` \n\n\n              ### Generate payload from UI \n\n              1. Visit https://web.mile.app/flow/flow \n  \n              2. Select Flow. \n  \n              3. Open **Configuration** tab. \n  \n              4. Click **API Example**. \n \n              5. Finnaly, there will be a complete description to create a task according to chosen flow.\n \n              6.
