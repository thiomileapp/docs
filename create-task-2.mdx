_Choosing Referred Field for Customer Name_
When configuring the details of a new task, you can fill in the components with text, refer to a component from the rule's flow, or leave it empty if the field is optional (required fields will be marked). **Example:** For the "Customer Name" field, you can choose from the available components based on their type. Components that are not of type Bill or List will be available.

**Note:** When mapping a **Bill** or **List** type component, only components of the same type will appear. This ensures consistency in component mapping.
