# Creating A Hub

The "**Hub**" is the main control center for your organizational tasks. It is usually the central place in your organization where field users start **their day**, such as the warehouse, office, or delivery center.

An organization can have **multiple** hubs that separate its tasks so everything stays organized. Users can be part of one or more hubs based on their tasks. This helps everyone to work together and finish tasks on time.

You can **switch** between hubs from the top right corner of almost any page.

You must create your first hub when registering your account, after which you can create, edit, and delete hubs from the [Setting ➝ Hub](https://web.mile.app/setting/hub) page.
