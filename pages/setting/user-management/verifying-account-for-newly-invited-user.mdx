# Verifying Account for Newly Invited User

After receiving the invitation email, the newly invited user should follow these steps to verify their account:
1. Check inbox email: Open the email inbox associated with the provided email address.
2. Find the activation email: Look for an email from your system containing the activation link. It should have a subject related to account verification.
3. Click on the activation link: Click on the activation link within the email. This will redirect the user to a verification page.
