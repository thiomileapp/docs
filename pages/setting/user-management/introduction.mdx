## User Listing and Filtering

The Setting-User menu gives you a comprehensive list of all registered users in the system. This list displays essential information such as the user's name, email address, and assigned role. To enhance user management, the menu offers filtering options that allow you to search for users by name or email address. Additionally, you can filter users based on their assigned roles, making locating and managing specific user profiles easier.

## Inviting New Users

With the Setting-User menu, you can invite new users to join your system. By utilizing the "Invite New Users" feature, you can send email invitations to individuals who have not yet registered. Provide their email addresses, and the system will invite them to create an account. This streamlined process ensures a smooth onboarding experience for new users.

## Re-sending Invitations

When users have not received or misplaced their invitation emails, the Setting-User menu allows you to re-send invitations. This feature ensures that users who missed their initial invitation can quickly receive it again. By resending invitations, you can ensure all intended users can access the system and its features.

</div>

## Editing User Information

The Setting-User menu lets you edit user information, specifically the user's name. If a user's name changes or updates, you can easily modify it within the system. This ensures that the displayed name accurately reflects the user's information and facilitates effective communication and identification.

</div>
<p><em>Access the "Profile" option.</em></p>

You can also add the user's phone number. Once it is saved, a WhatsApp icon will appear next to the phone number, allowing you to chat directly via WhatsApp.

## Managing Hub Access

A critical aspect of user management is controlling and regulating access to different hubs within the system. A hub is a centralized location for organizing and accessing specific information, data, or resources. The Managing Hub Access feature in the Setting-User menu allows you to determine which hubs a user has permission to access.

The hub access granted to a user directly impacts the filter hub functionality located in the right corner of every page. This filter lets users narrow the displayed information based on a specific hub. However, if users cannot access a particular hub, they cannot filter by that hub.

<div align="center">
  <img src="https://t3837933.p.clickup-attachments.com/t3837933/671377f2-8dce-4ba6-942a-3ca229b2e17d/image.png" alt="image" width="600" />
</div>
<p><em>Hub selection for a specific user</em></p>

For example, let's say there are three hubs in the system: Hub A, Hub B, and Hub C. If User X has been granted access to Hub A and Hub B but not Hub C, they will only be able to filter information based on Hub A and Hub B. The filter hub feature will not display Hub C as an option for User X since they cannot access it.

<div align="center">
  <img src="https://t3837933.p.clickup-attachments.com/t3837933/611762e5-395f-46a6-838e-9707bed5e03e/image.png" alt="image" width="600" />
</div>
<p><em>The hub filter is located in the top right corner of the Task page.</em></p>

By controlling hub access for each user, you can ensure they only see and interact with the hubs relevant to their role and responsibilities within the system. This helps maintain data integrity, security, and a streamlined user experience.

As an administrator or user with appropriate privileges, you can modify a user's hub access by editing their profile within the Setting-User menu. By granting or revoking hub access for specific users, you can effectively manage their ability to filter and access information related to different hubs.

## Managing Teams

The Team feature is designed to help you efficiently organize your organization by creating and managing teams. Teams are pivotal in streamlining task assignments, improving collaboration, and enhancing organizational efficiency.

<div align="center">

</div>
<p><em>Team selection for a specific user</em></p>

Please refer to our updated documentation for detailed instructions on using this feature.

## Editing User Roles

Within the Setting-User menu, you can edit the roles assigned to each user. A role defines a user's set of permissions and privileges within the system. By modifying a user's role, you can adjust their level of access, responsibilities, and available functionalities within the system. This feature ensures users have appropriate privileges based on their roles and responsibilities.

## Activating / Deactivating Users

Administrators can manage user status by activating or deactivating accounts. Deactivated users will be restricted from logging in through web and mobile applications.

<Note>
Required permission:
- View User
- Edit User
- View Role
</Note>

You will find a toggle switch in the **Active** column (next to the delete icon).

- **Toggle ON (Active)**: The user will have full system access, including web and mobile logins.
- **Toggle OFF (Inactive)**: The user will be deactivated and unable to log in to either web or mobile applications.

<div align="center">
  <img src="https://t3837933.p.clickup-attachments.com/t3837933/917162c0-8f12-442e-a5b2-285b95db739f/image.png" alt="image" width="600" />
</div>

When a user is deactivated while logged into the system, they will be immediately logged out. Any data that has not yet been synced to the server will remain on the user's device, allowing it to be synced later if their account is reactivated. However, data already synced to the server will be automatically removed from the device. This ensures that no additional synced data remains accessible after deactivation. If a deactivated user attempts to log in, they will receive the following message:

<div align="center">

</div>

5. After reviewing or editing the password, click **Submit** to confirm the reset.

Only users with the **Owner role** can reset passwords for other Owners.

</div>

## Deleting Users

In cases where user accounts need to be removed from the system, the Setting-User menu provides a "Delete User" option. This feature allows administrators to delete user accounts and all associated data and permissions permanently. Use this functionality cautiously, as it irreversibly removes user information from the system.

<Note>
Required permission:
- View User
- Delete User
</Note>

<div align="center">
  <img src="https://t3837933.p.clickup-attachments.com/t3837933/32c00f67-20f4-47ba-aa52-d4238e5a8900/image.png" alt="image" width="600" />
</div>
<p><em>"Delete User" button</em></p>

However, it's crucial to consider the implications before proceeding with the deletion. **If a user being deleted has ongoing tasks assigned**, those tasks will be changed to the "**Unassigned**" status. This ensures that functions associated with the deleted user do not go unattended and can be appropriately reassigned to other users for completion.
