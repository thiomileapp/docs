<p><em>Setting/Permission Menu</em></p>

1. **Set up Access Permission per Role** The Setting-Permission menu allows you to set up access permissions for each predefined default role and any custom roles you create. Access permissions define the actions and functionalities that each role can perform within the system. By configuring access permissions, you can control and restrict specific features and data based on role requirements. This feature ensures that users have appropriate access and privileges according to their responsibilities.

If the role is not granted access to a permission, the system will display this alert message, and you can contact your administrator to request access.

1. **Manage Custom Role** This feature allows you to create new custom roles, define their access permissions and responsibilities, edit the role names to suit your organizational terminology, and delete custom roles when they are no longer needed. By utilizing the Manage Custom Role functionality, you can tailor the system's roles to match your organization's specific requirements, providing granular control over access permissions and responsibilities for different user groups.

## Roles Overview

Upon successful registration and organization verification, your organization will be equipped with four distinct roles.

1. **Owner**: The Owner role holds absolute authority within the system. Owners have unrestricted access to all permissions and functionalities. This role cannot be switched off and is typically reserved for system administrators or high-level decision-makers. Unlike other roles, the Owner role cannot be switched off, renamed, or deleted.
2. **Admin**: The Admin role is responsible for managing the administration of the system. Similar to the Owner role, Admins have comprehensive access to permissions and functionalities. In other organizations, the Admin role can be assigned as the Field User Manager, responsible for overseeing field users' activities and optimizing their workflows.
3. **Planner**: The Planner role is designed for users responsible for managing tasks and routes for field users.
4. **Field User**: The Field User role represents users who perform tasks and operations in the field. This role is typically assigned to individuals such as drivers, sales representatives, or service technicians who execute tasks outside the office. Field Users have specific access permissions relevant to their responsibilities.
