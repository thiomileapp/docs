# Field Permission

The Field Permission grants access to menus such as Task, Tracking, and Schedule. Roles with this permission can create, assign, and manage tasks through the Task menu. They can track task progress and monitor performance using the Tracking menu. Additionally, they can utilize the Schedule menu to efficiently manage and organize task schedules.

1. **Create Task**: Users can create new tasks in the system. Depending on the specific role's permissions, you can define which flow tasks can be created for that role. Flow tasks represent different types or categories of tasks within the system. For example, a role may have permission to create sales-related tasks, maintenance tasks, or support tasks. By defining the allowed flow tasks for a role, you can ensure that users in that role can create tasks appropriate to their area of responsibility.
