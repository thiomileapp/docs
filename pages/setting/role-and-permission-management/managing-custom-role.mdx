Custom roles allow you to define unique access levels and responsibilities tailored to your organization's specific needs. The "Manage Custom Role" feature encompasses the following functionalities:

## Add New Custom Role

To create a new custom role, click on the "New" option within the Setting/Permission menu. This feature enables you to define a role with specific access permissions and responsibilities that align with your organization's structure and workflows. Customize the role by selecting the appropriate access permissions for the role's users.

  <p><i>Form create new role</i></p>
</div>

1. **Role Name**. Input a unique and specific name for the role.
2. **Initiate Role Permission (Optional)**. You have the option to create a role with predefined permissions for efficiency. If you choose this option, the new role you create will mirror the permissions you select
When you receive a message like this, it indicates that you need to choose another name as this role already exists.

## Edit Custom Role Name

The Setting-Permission menu allows you to edit the name of a custom role. This feature provides flexibility in naming roles according to your organization's terminology or naming conventions. By modifying the custom role name, you can ensure clarity and accuracy in role identification within your system.

## Delete Custom Role

If a custom role is no longer needed, the "Delete Custom Role" functionality allows you to remove it from the system. Deleting a custom role removes all associated access permissions and settings for that role. Please exercise caution when deleting custom roles, as this action is irreversible and any users assigned to the deleted role will lose their assigned permissions.

Click "Delete" to continue deleting the custom role

If you encounter an alert message when attempting to delete roles, it indicates that you must first revoke the role from the user before proceeding with the deletion.
