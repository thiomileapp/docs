## Organization Set up

If you are the first user from your Organization to register to the MileApp when you are registering your account to our [website](https://web.mile.app/) you will also set up your Organization info along with your account in one process. But, if your organization is already registered to the MileApp you could invite other users from the [Setting - User invite user feature](https://web.mile.app/setting/user) instead.

## Registration Process

There are 2 ways to register your email to MileApp, by using the Sign up with Google account button or sign up manually by inputting your email and password manually.

The difference between Sign up with Google button and the manual sign up is:

- If you use the **Sign up with Google button** you will be redirected to our Verification page, and you could continue the process from there.
- If you use the **manual Sign up method** you will need to confirm your email by clicking the activate button / copy the verification link on the email that we send to you before you could access the Verification page. This is the sample of the Verification email that you would receive after inputting your email & password at the manual sign up method:

After you finish the Registration step by using your Google account or manual sign up method, you will need to Verify your information at our verification process.
