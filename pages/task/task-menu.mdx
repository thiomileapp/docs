\*   Task enables you to manage your field user, for example, you could assign a Task to a Field user, after it was assigned they will see it on their mobile apps & could work on it through the apps.

\*   Another example is, if you create a Task that is suitable for Route Optimization, you could optimize the visit route and your field user could work on it through their mobile apps.

\*   Using a more advanced Task feature, you could create a task that is interconnected by using the Automation or Schedule feature.

\*   You could set up a custom Flow for a Task based on your needs. The flow would also affect the mobile apps, so you could specify what your Field user could do when they work on the Task.
