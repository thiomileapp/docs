After you click the add Bulk Task button, you'll see the form above, **and you have to choose a Flow setting (1) first,** after that you could use the Import Task function (2), as shown below:

1. After you choose a Task Flow that you'd like to import in bulk, download the templates for import based on that flow. 
2. You should automatically download the .xlsx file after clicking the download button, and open the file once it's downloaded. 
3. Fill in the information in the file 4. Drag and drop the file to this field to import the Task from the file that you have edited

After you have finished importing the task, the highlighted field will be updated according to the information that you input in the .xlsx file. You could still check and edit the information here before you submit the Task.

Choosing a Flow setting is necessary before starting an import Bulk Task action sequence, because flow setting would affect the information inside the .xlsx file, and would affect the result of the Imported Task on the web.

**Do**

If you want to import Task in bulk, please make sure you re-download Task's Flow import templates if you change any of the settings in the Flow.
