1. Repeat type
2. **Schedule Active Duration**: The schedule will only be active within the defined "Active From" and "Active To" dates. For example, if the "Active From" date has not yet started, the schedule won't be triggered automatically. Likewise, if the "Active To" date has passed, tasks will no longer be generated because the active duration has ended.
3. **Days & Hours Selection**: Set the specific day(s) and time(s) of the week when this schedule will be activated, and the tasks will be created.
4. **Add Time**: You can add multiple activation days and times within the week, allowing the schedule to trigger tasks on various days at specified times.
