1. Repeat type
2. **Schedule Active Duration**: The schedule will only be active within the "Active From" and "Active To" dates. If the "Active From" date has not started, the schedule wonâ€™t be triggered automatically. Similarly, if the "Active To" date has passed, tasks will no longer be generated as the active duration has ended.
3. **Days & Hours Selection**: Set the specific day(s) and time(s) of the month when this schedule will be activated, and tasks will be created.
4. **Add Time**: You can add multiple activation days and times within the month, allowing the schedule to trigger tasks on various days at specified times.
