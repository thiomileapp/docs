1. Repeat cycle type.
2. **Schedule Active Duration**: The schedule will only be active within the defined "Active From" and "Active To" dates. For example, if the "Active From" date has not yet started, the schedule won't be triggered automatically. Similarly, if the "Active To" date has passed, no further tasks will be generated because the active duration is no longer valid.
3. **Hours Selection**: Set the specific time of day when this schedule will be activated, and the task will be created.
4. **Add Hour**: You can add multiple activation times within the same day, allowing the schedule to trigger tasks at various hours throughout the day.
