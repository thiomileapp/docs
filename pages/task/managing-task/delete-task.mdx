You could Delete a single Task by using this Button (1), and you could also Delete multiple Tasks at once by using Checkbox & Action.

**Don't**

If you want to generate a valid Report, make sure you Export the Task Report that you wished to keep track of before you delete it. Be careful, if a Task is deleted, the Task data would not be shown when you Export the Task Report.
