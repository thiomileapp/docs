This is a guide to creating a working List component. First off you have to set the Flow correctly in the web flow builder, and then after you set it correctly, you could use it to create a task.

**Setting up the List flow on the web:**

</div>

**Setting up Initial Page:**

1. Flow name that you would use to create a Task
2. List component name on the Initial page, you should use this name to refer to the list component from the mobile app page
3. List type for this flow
4. Add new type to specify the type of list to be used. For example, using a new type, "select" will show the Section add list.
5. In the add list section, enter the list used in the list process. The example here is a list of Book and Rules. You can add as much data as needed. All the data is stored in the list master data.
6. Total list contains information about the total of the added list.
7. Added list data can be edited or deleted as needed.
8. Visibility of this component will affect: Create Task on the Web and Mobile; and View Task on the mobile app, if the component is not visible, it won't be shown on the UI. But, the visibility of a component didn't affect the export function, both Visible & Hidden component data will be exported.

**Setting up Page-N:**

4. Add a new type to specify the type of list to be used. For example, using a new type, "select" will show the Section add list. Field use list form has been filled with a list on the initial page so that data list will be referred to on this page.
5. The data in the add list section is automatically filled because it refers to the list created on the initial page that has been stored in the master data list. This data can be added, edited, or deleted according to the steps at points 5 - 7.
