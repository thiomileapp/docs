A data source is a feature that enables you to utilize data when creating or working on tasks. To use a data source, you must map the component flow with the data source on the Configuration Tab.

_Data source settings with flow_

To find out more about data sources, you can see here [Data Sources](https://doc.clickup.com/3837933/p/h/3n3zd-81962/aa00834626ae24f/3n3zd-95902)

The data source can only be stored with input, list and bill components. Here's how to map component flows with data sources.

**Input component :**

_Mapping Input Components with Data Sources_

Here are the explanations for each number on the image:
1. Component Using Data Source: If you select an input component, you have the option to map a data source to each of these components. Furthermore, this component will also serve as the primary key in points 3 and 3.a.
2. Type of Data Source Used: Here, you need to choose the type of data source that will be utilized in this process.
3. Component Mapped with Primary Key Data Source: This component will be linked to the primary key of the chosen data source. The component that's mapped will also act as a trigger to select the data source when creating or working on tasks. The information in this field will be automatically populated after you map the component in point number one.
4. Component Mapped with Data Source

_Mapping List Components with Data Sources_

Here are the explanations for the numbers on the image:
1. Selected Data Source Type: When choosing a data source type, ensure that the selected type has a Text field available for mapping with "Item Name," and a Number field available for mapping with "Item Qty."
2. Reserved Key "Item Name" and Text Field Type: Please note that the reserved key "Item Name" can only be mapped with a data source that has a Text field type. Ensure that you correctly map it according to the required field type.
3. Reserved Key "Item Qty" and Number Field Type: Similarly, the reserved key "Item Qty" can only be mapped with a data source that has a Number field type. Make sure to select the appropriate field type when mapping "Item Qty."

Please refer to the provided image while following the explanations above. If you have any further questions, feel free to reach out to our support team.

The bill component, it's quite similar to the list component, with the addition of one required reserved key to be mapped, which is "Item Price." Also, regarding the item price, it can only be mapped with a data source that has a Number field type.
