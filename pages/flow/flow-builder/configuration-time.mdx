Time configuration could be used to set the Start and the End time of a Task.

1. Start Time will define when a Task should be started to work on by the Field user, you could set it based on your needs, the default value is 0 hours from the time the Task is created, so by default a Task could be started right away after it is created.
2. End Time will define the deadline of a Task, you could set it based on your needs, the default value is 24 hours from the time the Task is started, so with default configuration, if you create a Task it will expire in 24 hours.
