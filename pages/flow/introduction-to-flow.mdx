[**Flow**](https://web.mile.app/flow/flow) in MileApp is the mobile field application workflow, setting it correctly is critical to the success of the field workers in doing their job efficiently. Flow defines how information is presented to the field workers and what data they need to fill in and update on the mobile app.

An organization is allowed to create an unlimited number of Flows, regardless of its license plan, enabling it to utilize MileApp for various field operations. For instance, an organization acting as a distributor can use MileApp for pickup, delivery, and field sales. However, each Flow has a component limit based on the organization’s license plan:
*   Free: 50 components
*   Pro: 200 components
*   Enterprise: As needed

Components are the building blocks of flow, MileApp comes with various components that can be used in a flow such as:
*   View component ➝ used to present information to user in the form of text, image, link, date, etc.
*   Input component ➝ used to give input
*   Select component ➝ used to give options
*   Photo component ➝ used to capture image from camera
*   Signature component ➝ used to verify identity
*   Bill component ➝ Used to display and manage billing information
*   List component ➝ Used to display and manage of information in a list format
*   Timer component ➝ used to track the duration of a task
