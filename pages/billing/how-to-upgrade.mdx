If you're unable to pay the invoice or if someone else in your company will handle it, you can share the payment link by clicking the "Copy Link" or "Share by WhatsApp" button.

Once your payment is successful, your selected plan will be available to you for a duration of 30 days, unlocking all the features and benefits associated with it.

<Note>
Once you submit, you can cancel the subscription if you change your mind, and the generated invoice will become **void**.
</Note>

## What Happens if You Don't Pay the Invoice?

We understand that situations may arise where you are unable to pay your invoice immediately. Here's what you can expect:

1. **Grace Period**: You have a grace period of 29 days from the date the invoice is generated to make the payment
2. **Plan Status**: If you do not make the payment within the 29-day grace period, your account will remain on the Free plan. This means you will lose access to the premium features and benefits associated with the Paid plan
