A Visit is a term used at MileApp to represent the destination of a field user. Visits can represent various activities, such as a delivery location, a pickup location, a home visit location, and more. Visits are generated from Routable Tasks that have proper [Flow](https://web.mile.app/flow/flow) configurations. You can add a new Visit from the [Task](https://web.mile.app/tasks/task) menu.
