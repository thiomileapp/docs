### Vehicle

\*   **Vehicle Optimized**: Displays the percentage of assigned vehicles versus unused vehicles. For example, `15/15 (100%)` means that all 15 vehicles have been assigned visits, resulting in 100% utilization. \*   **Visit Optimized**: Displays the percentage of routed visits versus unrouted visits. For example, `43/43 (100%)` means that all 43 visits have been routed into the vehicles, resulting in 100% optimization. \*   **Total Distance**: Displays the total distance covered by all assigned vehicles in kilometers. For example, `234 km`. \*   **Average Speed**: Displays the average speed of all assigned vehicles. If "Auto Speed" is selected in the configuration, it will show "auto".

### Time

\*   **Total Travel Time**: Displays the total duration of all assigned vehicles. For example, `9h 51min` means the total travel time for all vehicles is 9 hours and 51 minutes. \*   **Total Visit Time**: Displays the total duration of all assigned vehicles when they arrive at visit locations, such as during handovers or unloading. For example, `36h 48min` means the total visit time for all vehicles is 36 hours and 48 minutes. \*   **Total Waiting Time**: Displays the total duration of all assigned vehicles before they can process tasks, such as when waiting for a store to open. The waiting time is related to the "Open Time" data per visit. \*   **Total Spent Time**: The sum of total travel time, total visit time, and total waiting time. \*   **Range of Finish Time**: The earliest to the latest finish time of all assigned vehicles. For example, `7:32 - 16:42` means the earliest finish time is 7:32 and the latest finish time is 16:42. \*   **Average Finish Time**: The average finish time of all assigned vehicles. For example, `10:05` means the average finish time is 10:05.

### Capacity

The capacity field is dynamic based on the configuration used. For example, `Total Weight 2,000 / 2,300 kg (86%)` means a total of 2,000 kg is optimized out of a maximum total of 2,300 kg across all vehicles, resulting in 86% optimization.

### Others

This section shows the configuration settings used. For example, if the "Return to Hub" option is activated, there will be a checklist icon; otherwise, it will show an X icon. Additionally, it displays the source of the routing optimization and the creation details, such as: \*   **Created from**: WEB \*   **Created Date**: 22 July 2024
