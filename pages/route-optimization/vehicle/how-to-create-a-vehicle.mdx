1. **Click the "New" button** to add a new vehicle.
2. **Load Sample Data**: Use this option to view an example of vehicle data.
3. **Fill in the Necessary Fields** for each vehicle.

When finished, click the **Submit** button to continue.\
The newly created vehicle will be active by default.

Below are detailed guidelines for each input:

1. **Name**\
   Input the vehicle's name, which can include identifiers like a police number\
   (e.g. `B 1234 SYZ`).
2. **Assignee**\
   Select the user to be assigned to this vehicle, or leave this empty.\
   You can assign the user later when routing is done.
3. **Working Time**\
   Specify the vehicle's daily working hours.\
   If not specified, the default is **08:00 to 17:00**.\
   Empty vehicles adopt the working hours of others if specified.\
   For more detail, please see the **Working Time** section below.
4. **Break Time**\
   Configure break time for the vehicle within the specified working start and end time.\
   For more detail, please see the **Break Time** section below.
5. **Speed**\
   Define the vehicle's speed. The minimum value is **5 km/h**.\
   Note: this field will be disabled if you activate **Auto Speed** in the Configuration page.
6. **Cost Factor**\
   The Cost Factor value ranges from **0 to 100**, with the default set to `0`.\
   A lower number indicates a higher priority for routing optimization.
7. **Vehicle Tags**\
   Use tags to pair visits with vehicles.\
   Make sure one or more vehicle tags match the tags of the visit you wish to assign.\
   Please refer to the scenarios below for more understanding:
   1. **Scenario 1**\
      If a vehicle has 2 tags (`"a"` and `"b"`) while the visit has 3 tags (`"a"`, `"b"`, and `"c"`),\
      then this visit will be **dropped**.
   2. **Scenario 2**\
      If a vehicle has 3 tags (`"a"`, `"b"`, and `"c"`) while the visit also has 3 tags (`"a"`, `"b"`, and `"c"`),\
      then this visit will be **optimized**.
   3. **Scenario 3**\
      If a vehicle has 4 tags (`"a"`, `"b"`, `"c"`, and `"d"`) while the visit has 3 tags (`"a"`, `"b"`, and `"c"`),\
      then this visit will be **optimized**.
1. **Capacity Constraint**\
   Define the minimum and maximum capacity for each vehicle.\
   The capacity is based on the selected capacity in the **Routing / Configuration** menu.

## Working Time

By default, the timeframe is set from **08:00 to 17:00**.\
Users can adjust this according to their specific requirements.

This parameter restricts any visits to occur **within the specified timeframe**.\
Empty vehicles (vehicles without explicitly defined working hours) will adopt the working hours of other vehicles if specified.

Additionally, if the **Return to hub** parameter is enabled, users have the option to set the working time for **more than one day**.\
This allows route planning across multiple days at once.

### Working Time Validation

When inputting working hours, ensure that the **start time is earlier than the end time**.\
Otherwise, a validation message will appear and you must correct the values before proceeding.

## Break Time

When configuring breaks for multi-day operations, the break schedule remains consistent across all days.

**Example:**\
If the Working Time spans from **07:00 to 17:00 (+1 day)** and the Break Time is set from **12:00 to 13:00**,\
the vehicle will take a break from **12:00 to 13:00 each day**.

For a better understanding of how working time, break time, and multi-day settings interact, see the following scenarios:

- If the **break start time falls after the end of the working time**, the optimization will **fail**.\
  Example:
  - Working Time: `19:00 - 05:00 +1 day` (7:00 PM - 5:00 AM)
  - Break Time: `06:00 - 07:00` (6:00 AM - 7:00 AM)
- If the **break occurs within the working time**, the optimization will **succeed**.\
  Example:
  - Working Time: `19:00 - 05:00 +1 day` (7:00 PM - 5:00 AM)
  - Break Time: `00:00 - 01:00` (12:00 AM - 1:00 AM)
- If the **break start time is earlier than the start of the working time**, the optimization will **fail**.\
  Example:
  - Working Time: `19:00 - 05:00 +1 day` (7:00 PM - 5:00 AM)
  - Break Time: `18:00 - 19:00` (6:00 PM - 7:00 PM)

### Break Time Validation

Similar to working time validation, ensure that the **break start time is earlier than the break end time** to avoid validation errors.
