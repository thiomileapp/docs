## How to Activate Avoid Toll Roads

1. Go to the **Routing ‚ûù Configuration** menu.

Once activated, the route optimization will automatically exclude toll roads when generating routes.

You can disable this option anytime if you want the system to include toll roads again in future optimizations.
