# Introduction

Configuration involves defining the parameters and inputs that the system will use to calculate the optimal route. By carefully configuring the routing optimization system, you can ensure it is tailored to your specific needs and can produce the best possible results.

Within a configuration, you will find the following settings: <div align="center">

</div> _Routing Configuration page_ 1. **Filter Hub**. Each configuration is unique to its hub. 2. **Auto Speed and Default Speed**. \*   When unchecked, you can define the default speed manually. \*   If you choose to use auto speed, it will automatically adjust based on historical data. 3. **Default Visit Time**. \*   Specifies the duration required for a worker to complete a task in one visit if not specified in the visit data. \*   Additionally, there is a dynamic visit time based on the selected capacity.

## Managing Routing Configuration Profiles

Managing routing configuration profiles allows you to customize and optimize routing setups for different needs without repeatedly adjusting settings. You can have multiple profiles for each hub, with no maximum limit. This allows you to set up different configurations for various routing scenarios.

### **Profile Creation and Editing**

Use the "Save as Profile" button to create a new profile. Enter a unique name for the profile when prompted. <div align="center">

</div> To rename a profile, click the edit icon next to the profile name in the Profile Manager dialog. <div align="center">

</div>

### **Profile Deletion**

Click the delete icon next to the profile name in the Profile Manager dialog. Confirm the deletion in the pop-up dialog. **Note** that you cannot delete the last remaining profile in the hub. <div align="center">

</div>

### **Profile Selection**

Select from existing profiles using the dropdown. If no profile is created, the "Default Profile" is selected by default. <div align="center">

</div>

Profiles are optional. You can still optimize routing even if no profile is set; in such cases, the Default Profile will be automatically selected.

## Optimize

If you have visits ready and all necessary configurations set, you can start the optimization process by clicking the "Optimize" button located below the vehicle list.<div align="center">

</div> If no visits are available, the button will display "Input Visit" and redirect you to the Visit page.
