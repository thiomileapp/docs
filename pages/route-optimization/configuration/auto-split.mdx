# Auto Split

With Auto Split, the system will automatically split visits with a capacity of more than any single vehicle into several visits to generate results without dropping the large visit. This feature will only evaluate vehicles that have **matching tags** to determine if splitting is required.

## Activate the Auto Split

To activate Auto Split, follow these steps:

1. Go to the Routing/Configuration menu.
2. Check the "Auto Split" checkbox.
3. Two split types will be available:
   - Split capacity equally
   - Maximize vehicle capacity.

<Note>
Only the first defined capacity will be considered in the routing optimization process.

## Route Optimization

### Example using "Split capacity equally" type:

  <p><i>The first segment of the visit "Sven Arvidsson" in vehicle 1</i></p>

  <p><i>The second segment of the visit "Sven Arvidsson" in vehicle 2</i></p>
</div>

The routing result for the visit "Sven Arvidsson" has been split into two visits equally, with each visit having a capacity of 1750 out of the total 3500.

### Example using "Maximize vehicle capacity" type:

<div align="center">
  <img src="https://t3837933.p.clickup-attachments.com/t3837933/1a65a638-0965-4d03-97f6-a5a88a4ffcd6/image.png" alt="First segment maximized in vehicle 1" width="600" />
  <p><i>The first segment of the visit "Sven Arvidsson" in vehicle 1</i></p>
</div>

<div align="center">
  <img src="https://t3837933.p.clickup-attachments.com/t3837933/63fe2627-4b06-42dc-801a-717d33aa8775/image.png" alt="Remaining capacity in vehicle 2" width="600" />
  <p><i>The second segment of the visit "Sven Arvidsson" in vehicle 2</i></p>
</div>

As depicted, the first segment will utilize the maximum capacity of the vehicle, 3000, while the remaining capacity, 500, will be allocated to the second segment.

## Exporting Data

When exporting data, the "Other" sheet will include information about the Auto Split type.

## Dispatching Visits

Upon clicking "Dispatch," the system initiates background processing to assign tasks based on routing results. If a visit is split into multiple segments, a new task is generated for each segment, maintaining data integrity and ensuring accurate capacity allocation. The original task's capacity is updated accordingly to reflect the split.

### Important Notes:

1. It is **recommended** to configure the capacity constraint field with the component in the task from the Flow menu. Failure to do so may result in an empty capacity constraint in the Routing/Visit menu, which can be manually inputted later.

2. Upon dispatching, the detailed task will display information regarding the split type and split number. However, if the split visit is on the dropped list, it will retain the original task and remain "Unassigned."

</div>

3. If you exceed your task quota, failed dispatches may occur, as a new task is generated based on the split number during dispatching.

4. When Auto Split is used in conjunction with the Auto Merge feature, identical coordinate visits will not be split across different vehicles.
