### **How to Use**

1. Go to **Routing → Configuration** and enable the **Odd-Even Rule** toggle.
2. Set the **time range** when the odd-even rule applies, according to your operational needs.
3. Define your **vehicle type** — whether it falls under the _Odd_ or _Even_ category based on the license plate.
4. Select the **date** when the route will be executed to determine if the vehicle is allowed to pass through odd or even restricted roads.
5. Click **Optimize** to run the route optimization process.
6. The optimized route — considering odd-even restrictions — can be viewed under **Routing → Result**.

### **Notes**

- Using this rule helps you generate routes that comply with Jakarta’s odd-even road policy.
- Once enabled, the setting will be **saved** for future routing processes and can be **modified anytime** as needed.
- The **Odd-Even Rule** currently applies **only to roads within the Jakarta province, Indonesia**.
