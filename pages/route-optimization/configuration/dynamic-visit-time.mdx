title: "Dynamic Visit Time"
---

This feature enables you to customize visit times according to capacity constraints. By default, visit times are provided per visit in the Routing/Visit menu. However, if you prefer dynamic visit times based on capacity constraints, you can utilize this feature.

## Configure The Dynamic Visit Time

1. Navigate to **Routing/Configuration** menu.
2. Look for the Default Visit Time input field.
3. Adjacent to this field, you will find the **Dynamic Visit Time** icon.

</div>

4. Hover over the icon to view tooltip text for **guidance**.
5. **Click** on the Dynamic Visit Time icon to initiate configuration.
6. A **pop-up window** will appear, displaying checked capacity constraints.

7. **Define the visit time for each capacity constraint** according to your requirements.
8. If you do not wish to utilize a specific capacity constraint for routing optimization, you can either set its visit time to zero (**0**).
9. Once you have configured the dynamic visit times for capacity constraints, click the "**Submit**" button to save your changes.

- If the per-visit visit time is unspecified, it will be calculated as the sum of the default visit time and dynamic visit time.
- If both per-visit visit time and default visit time are specified, priority is given to the per-visit visit time.
