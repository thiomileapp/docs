If you pick Move Task (1) automation type, you have to choose the Hub (2) destination, the Task will be moved to the Hub that is chosen if this type of Automation is triggered.

In the example above, the chosen Hub is "Hub 1", so when the Automation is triggered the Task will automatically move to "Hub 1" regardless of on which Hub it was created.
