If you pick Assign Task automation type (1), you have to choose the Hub & assign a Field user (2), if triggered, the Automation will be assigned a Task to that assigned user in that selected Hub.

In the example above, the Field user that was assigned is "mileapp", and the Field user's Task will be placed in the "Hub 1". So, a new Task that fit this Automation setting will be automatically assigned to "mileapp" in the "Hub 1".
