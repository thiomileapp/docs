If you pick Create Task (1) automation type, you have to choose the Flow setting

You could Fill the Component of the Flow (2) with Text, or Refer to a component from the Trigger's Flow (3), or leave it empty because it was optional.

In the example above, the "Visit" Task will be Created by the Automation when a "Home Clean Service" Task is assigned, and in the "Visit" Task that was created, the "Receiver Name" will be filled with the "Order Number" from the "Home Clean Service" Task.
